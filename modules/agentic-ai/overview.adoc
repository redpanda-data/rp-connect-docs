= Agentic AI with Redpanda Connect
:description: Build, deploy, and manage AI agents using Redpanda's superior connectivity, standardized HTTP endpoints (via MCP), a robust distributed log for durability, and a developer-friendly Python SDK.

Redpanda Connect simplifies Agentic AI development by providing connectivity and tools that accelerate the integration of autonomous AI agents into your existing infrastructure.

== What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI is a transformative approach to artificial intelligence that empowers software agents to operate autonomously, making decisions and taking actions without constant human intervention. This paradigm shift enables organizations to leverage AI for complex tasks, enhancing efficiency and innovation across various domains.

Agentic programs empower Large Language Models (LLMs) by granting them agency: The ability to interact with external systems and make real-world decisions. By integrating LLM outputs into code, you can provide varying degrees of agency, from simple workflow enhancements to fully autonomous agents capable of executing complex, iterative tasks. Redpanda Connect supports the full spectrum of agentic capabilities, ensuring efficient, secure, and scalable integration.

Agentic AI is not just about automating repetitive tasks, it involves creating intelligent agents that can learn, adapt, and improve over time. These agents can analyze data, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions based on their findings. By harnessing the power of Agentic AI, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth and efficiency.

== When to use agents

Agents are ideal when workflows require flexibility that pre-defined automation can't efficiently handle. If your application needs to dynamically adjust based on complex inputs, leveraging multiple data sources, APIs, or dynamic business logic, agents provide valuable adaptability. For example, handling personalized customer inquiries about availability, insurance coverage, and real-time logistics.

Consider a scenario where a customer inquires about the availability of a specific product. An agentic system can autonomously query multiple APIs, such as inventory databases, shipping providers, and customer profiles, to provide a personalized response. This level of adaptability and responsiveness is challenging to achieve with traditional automation methods.

Agents are also beneficial when tasks require continuous learning and adaptation. If your workflows involve complex decision-making processes that evolve over time, agents can autonomously learn from new data and adjust their strategies accordingly. This is particularly valuable in domains such as fraud detection, predictive maintenance, and personalized marketing.

For example, in fraud detection, an agentic system can continuously analyze transaction data, learning from new patterns and adapting its detection algorithms to identify emerging fraudulent behaviors. This level of adaptability is challenging to achieve with traditional automation methods.

== When not to use agents

Agents are not suitable for every scenario. If your workflows are simple, repetitive, and well-defined, traditional automation methods may be more efficient and cost-effective. In such cases, the complexity and overhead of implementing agents may outweigh the benefits.

For example, if your application involves processing standard transactions with well-defined rules, a traditional automation approach may be more suitable. In such cases, agents may introduce unnecessary complexity and overhead.

== Why use Redpanda for Agentic AI?

Redpanda Connect is the ideal platform for building and deploying Agentic AI solutions. It provides a robust, scalable, and developer-friendly environment that simplifies the integration of AI agents with existing systems. By leveraging Redpanda's distributed log architecture, you can ensure durable execution, seamless communication, and efficient data handling for their autonomous agents.
Redpanda Connect streamlines the implementation of Agentic AI by providing scalable infrastructure, developer-friendly tools, and robust security controls. Our integrated suite enables engineers to quickly build, deploy, and manage autonomous agents that leverage internal data securely and efficiently.

Benefits include:

- Developer experience: Simplify agent development and integration with the Redpanda Python SDK.

- Durable execution: Leverage Redpanda's distributed log for resilient workflows, ensuring reliable agent-to-agent communication, traceability, analytics, debugging, and human-in-the-loop interaction.

- Seamless integration: Access hundreds of pre-built connectors through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling secure and simple access to internal systems via standardized HTTP endpoints.

- Security and compliance: Built-in fine-grained access controls, secure connectivity, authentication, and auditing ensure enterprise data remains protected within organizational boundaries.

== Privacy and model flexibility

Redpanda Connect's architecture is designed to support both local and remote AI models, providing you with the flexibility to choose the best approach for their specific needs. This dual model capability allows you to leverage the strengths of both local and remote models, ensuring optimal performance and security.

Local models can be deployed within your infrastructure, providing enhanced data privacy and control. This is particularly important if you handle sensitive data or operate in regulated industries where data privacy is paramount.

Remote models, on the other hand, can be accessed through secure connections, allowing you to leverage the power of cloud-based AI services without compromising data security. This flexibility enables you to choose the right model for each use case, ensuring that it can meet your requirements while maximizing the benefits of Agentic AI.

== How it works

The integration is powered by three core components:

- Distributed Log (Redpanda storage): Provides durability for agent communication, logging, metrics, and time-travel debugging, supporting transparency and explainability in agent workflows.

- MCP server: Exposes your internal tools as HTTP endpoints through YAML or Python, handling complexities such as authentication, connection pooling, retries, and security.

- Python SDK: Offers an intuitive and standardized development experience with seamless integration capabilities, supporting durable execution, metrics collection, and fine-grained content filtering.
