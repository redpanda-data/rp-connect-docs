// Reader journey: "I want AI clients to discover and use my tools effectively"
// Learning objectives - what readers should be able to do after reading this page:
:learning-objective-1: Write tool names and descriptions that help AI clients select the right tool
:learning-objective-2: Define input properties with appropriate types and constraints
:learning-objective-3: Organize tools using tags and manage secrets securely

This page covers how to design MCP tool interfaces so AI clients can discover, understand, and invoke your tools correctly.

After reading this page, you will be able to:
