[[support-and-licensing]]
== Component support levels and licensing

Redpanda Connect components have different support levels and licensing requirements. Understanding these helps you make informed decisions when building MCP tools.

=== Support levels

Components fall into two support categories:

Certified components:: Officially supported by Redpanda. These components receive regular updates, bug fixes, and are tested for production use. Use certified components when reliability and support are priorities.

Community components:: Contributed by the community. These may have varying levels of maintenance and testing. Review the component documentation and consider your risk tolerance before using in production.

=== Enterprise licensing

Some components require a Redpanda Enterprise license. These include certain cloud-provider integrations, advanced security features, and some enterprise data source connectors.

If you use an Enterprise-licensed component without a valid license, the MCP server will not start, and you'll see an error indicating the missing license.

The xref:components:about.adoc[component reference documentation] displays support level and license badges on each component page.

See xref:get-started:licensing.adoc[Redpanda licensing] for more information about licenses.
