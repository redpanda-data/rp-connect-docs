== Key terms

MCP server:: A process that exposes tools to MCP clients. You write each tool's logic using Redpanda Connect configuration and annotate them with MCP metadata so clients can discover and invoke them.

Redpanda Connect:: A framework for building event-driven data pipelines. Tools inside your MCP server are implemented as Redpanda Connect configurations.

Tool:: A single request/response operation exposed to MCP clients. Each tool has logic (what it does) and metadata (how AI understands it).

[[support-and-licensing]]
== Component support levels and licensing

Redpanda Connect components have different support levels and licensing requirements. Understanding these helps you make informed decisions when building MCP tools.

=== Support levels

Components fall into two support categories:

Certified components:: Officially supported by Redpanda. These components receive regular updates, bug fixes, and are tested for production use. Use certified components when reliability and support are priorities.

Community components:: Contributed by the community. These may have varying levels of maintenance and testing. Review the component documentation and consider your risk tolerance before using in production.

=== Enterprise licensing

Some components require a Redpanda Enterprise license. These include certain cloud-provider integrations, advanced security features, and some enterprise data source connectors.

If you use an Enterprise-licensed component without a valid license, the MCP server will not start, and you'll see an error indicating the missing license.

To determine a component's support level and licensing requirements:

. Check the xref:components:about.adoc[component reference documentation].
. Look for "Support Level" and "License" badges on each component page.
. Review the component's feature matrix for any restrictions.

=== License status

When the MCP server starts, it logs the license status:

[source]
----
level=INFO msg="Successfully loaded Redpanda license" license_type="enterprise" expires_at=...
----

If you see `license_type="open source"`, Enterprise-licensed components are not available.
