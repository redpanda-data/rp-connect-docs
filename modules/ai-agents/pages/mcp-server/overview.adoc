== What is Redpanda Connect MCP server?

Redpanda Connect's MCP server lets you expose data pipelines and automations as AI-consumable tools (MCP tools) with no custom API code. You write tools as YAML configurations, and the MCP server makes them available to AI assistants.

This means AI assistants can:

* Pull information from databases, APIs, message queues, or Redpanda topics
* Publish messages, update records, trigger workflows, or call external services
* Only access the specific tools you configure and enable

If you already use Redpanda Connect for data integration and processing, adding an MCP server gives AI assistants controlled access to your existing systems without extra development effort.

== How it works

When you start an MCP server, it runs locally on your system and acts as a bridge between AI clients and your data:

. A user asks their AI assistant something like "What's the weather in London?"
. The AI client connects to the local MCP server and finds the matching tool
. The server runs your MCP tools
. Your tools fetch data, transform it, and return a response
. The AI assistant gets the data and can use it to answer the user

=== What an MCP tool looks like

An MCP tool in Redpanda Connect is a YAML file with two parts: the logic (what the tool does) and the metadata (how AI understands it).

Here's a minimal example that returns weather data:

[source,yaml]
----
http:
  url: "https://wttr.in/${! this.city }?format=j1"
  verb: GET

meta:
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    name: get_weather
    description: "Get current weather for a city"
    properties:
      - name: city
        type: string
        description: "City name"
        required: true
----

When an AI client asks about weather, it calls this tool with the city name. The tool fetches data from the weather API and returns it.
