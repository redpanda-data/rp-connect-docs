== What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets AI assistants use tools. Think of it like a universal adapter: instead of building custom integrations for every AI system, you define your tools once using MCP, and any MCP-compatible AI client can discover and use them.

Without MCP, connecting AI to your business systems requires custom API code, authentication handling, and response formatting for each AI platform. With MCP, you describe what a tool does and what inputs it needs, and the protocol handles the rest.

== What Redpanda Connect adds

Redpanda Connect's MCP server lets you expose data pipelines and automations as AI-consumable tools with no custom API code. You write tools as simple YAML configurations, and the MCP server makes them available to AI assistants.

This means AI assistants can:

* Pull information from databases, APIs, message queues, or Redpanda topics
* Publish messages, update records, trigger workflows, or call external services
* Only access the specific tools you configure and enable

The result? AI that works with your real business data and systems, not just static information.

== Who is this for?

|===
| You want to | MCP servers can help you

| Add AI capabilities to existing systems
| Expose your APIs, databases, and data streams to AI assistants without rewriting them

| Build AI agents that access real-time data
| Create tools that query live data and trigger business workflows

| Prototype AI features quickly
| Define tools in YAML and iterate without deploying new code

| Give AI controlled access to business logic
| Expose specific operations while keeping other systems private

== How it works

The MCP server sits between AI clients and your data:

. A user asks their AI assistant something like "What's the weather in London?"
. The server finds the matching tool and runs your Redpanda Connect configuration
. Your configuration fetches data, transforms it, and returns a structured response
. The AI assistant gets the data and can use it to answer the user

=== What a tool looks like

A tool is a YAML file with two parts: the logic (what the tool does) and the metadata (how AI understands it).

Here's a minimal example that returns weather data:

[source,yaml]
----
http:
  url: "https://wttr.in/${! this.city }?format=j1"
  verb: GET

meta:
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    name: get_weather
    description: "Get current weather for a city"
    properties:
      - name: city
        type: string
        description: "City name"
        required: true
----

When an AI client asks about weather, it calls this tool with the city name. The tool fetches data from the weather API and returns it.
