:description: Discover the business value, use cases, and architecture for Redpanda Connect MCP servers.

Redpanda Connect's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server lets you expose your data, analytics, and automations as AI-consumable tools with no custom API code. It bridges your business logic to AI agents using the open MCP standard so you can:

* Make your data and workflows accessible to AI assistants and LLMs, safely and on your terms.
* Accelerate automation and insight by letting AI trigger real business actions.
* Control exposure so that only the tools you tag are visible to AI.

== How it works

. You define a tool as a YAML configuration in Redpanda Connect, describing its inputs, outputs, and logic.
. The MCP server loads these tools and exposes them as HTTP endpoints, discoverable by AI agents through the MCP protocol.
. AI clients can list, inspect, and invoke tools to trigger real business actions or analytics with validated, structured input.
. All tool metadata is optimized for LLMs, so AI can understand what each tool does and how to use it.
