TIP: For background on how MCP tools work and when to use each component type, see xref:ai-agents:mcp-server/concepts.adoc[].

== Prerequisites

You'll need the following to complete this quickstart:

- xref:ROOT:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[Redpanda CLI (`rpk`)]
- link:https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup[Claude Code^]

== Initialize an MCP server project

To get started, create a new MCP server project using the Redpanda CLI.

. Create a directory for your MCP server project:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir redpanda-connect-mcp
cd redpanda-connect-mcp
----

. Initialize the MCP server project:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk connect mcp-server init
----
+
This command scaffolds your project with the necessary directories and template YAML files for defining tools and observability resources.
+
[.no-copy]
----
├── o11y
│   ├── metrics.yaml
│   └── tracer.yaml
└── resources
    ├── caches
    │   └── example-cache.yaml
    ├── inputs
    │   └── example-input.yaml
    ├── outputs
    │   └── example-output.yaml
    └── processors
        └── example-processor.yaml
----

. Make sure your Redpanda Connect version is at least 4.66.1:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk connect --version
----
+
If you need to upgrade, see xref:install:rpk.adoc#upgrade[Upgrade Redpanda Connect].

== Create a tool definition

In this step, you'll create an MCP tool that searches public link:https://bsky.app/[Bluesky^] posts using a customizable query. You'll define this configuration as a tool that Claude can discover and use.

Save the following YAML to a file named `bluesky.yaml` and save it in the `resources/processors/` directory:

[source,yaml]
----
label: search-bluesky-posts <1>
try: <2>
  - mutation: |
      root.limit = root.limit.number(10)
      root.limit = [ root.limit, 100 ].min()
      root.limit = [ root.limit, 1 ].max()
      meta query_string = "q=" + root.query.escape_url_query() + "&limit=%v".format(root.limit)
      root = ""
  - http:
      url: "https://api.bsky.app/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.searchposts?${! @query_string }"
      verb: GET
  - mapping: 'root = this.posts'
  - unarchive:
      format: json_array

meta:
  tags: [ bluesky ] <3>
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    description: Search public Bluesky posts based on a query string. <4>
    properties: <5>
      - name: query
        type: string
        required: true
        description: A Lucene-style query string to search posts.
      - name: limit
        type: number
        description: Number of posts to return (1-100). Defaults to 10.
----

This example defines a tool that searches public Bluesky posts based on a query string. Important parts of the configuration include:

<1> A unique label for identification. Claude uses this label to discover and call the tool.
<2> A series of xref:ai-agents:mcp-server/concepts.adoc#component-selection[processors] to build the HTTP request, handle the response, and format the output.
<3> A unique tag (`bluesky`) to control exposure. You can use tags to group related tools or isolate experiments.
<4> A clear description for LLMs helps Claude understand what the tool does. See xref:ai-agents:mcp-server/create-tool.adoc#anatomy[Anatomy of an MCP tool].
<5> Structured properties for inputs like `query` and `limit`.

== Start the MCP server

. Navigate to your MCP server project directory if you're not already there:
+
[,bash]
----
cd redpanda-connect-mcp
----

. Start the MCP server to expose the tool over HTTP:
+
[source,bash]
----
rpk connect mcp-server --address localhost:4195 --tag bluesky
----
+
You should see output like this:
+
[.no-copy]
----
time=2025-06-27T15:20:27.976+01:00 level=INFO msg="Registering processor tool" label=search-bluesky-posts
time=2025-06-27T15:20:27.978+01:00 level=INFO msg="Successfully loaded Redpanda license" expires_at=2035-06-25T15:20:27+01:00 license_org="" license_type="open source"
----
+
This command creates an MCP server listening on `localhost:4195`, and makes your tool discoverable to AI agents. Leave this terminal open while you interact with Claude Code.

:tip-caption: Limit exposure

[TIP]
====
Only tools with the specified `--tag` are exposed. This helps you:

- Keep experiments isolated
- Avoid exposing sensitive functionality accidentally
- Create sets of tools that are relevant to specific agents or workflows
====

:tip-caption: Tip

== Connect Claude Code to your MCP server

Now that your MCP server is running and exposing tools, you can connect Claude Code so it can discover and use them.

Claude Code communicates with MCP servers using the standard input/output (stdio) transport protocol. Because your Redpanda Connect MCP server exposes tools over HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE), you need a bridge to convert between these protocols. The link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote[`mcp-remote` utility^] provides this bridge.

When you connect Claude Code:

- `mcp-remote` subscribes to your server's SSE endpoint (`http://localhost:4195/sse`).
- It translates HTTP/SSE messages into stdio format that Claude understands.
- Claude automatically discovers your tools and their metadata.
- You can ask Claude in natural language to use your tools.
- Claude calls the appropriate tool based on your request.

To set up this connection:

. Open a new terminal window.

. To install `mcp-remote`, run:
+
[,bash]
----
claude mcp add local -- npx mcp-remote http://localhost:4195/sse
----
+
You should see output like this:
+
[.no-copy]
----
Added stdio MCP server local with command: npx mcp-remote http://localhost:4195/sse to local config
----

. Verify that the local input channel is set up correctly by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
claude /mcp
----
+
You should see an entry for `local`.

. Press *Enter* until you see the tools list.
+
[.no-copy,role="no-wrap"]
----
Tools for local (1 tools)
│ ❯ 1. search-bluesky-posts
----

. Press *Esc* until you return to the main prompt.

== Use the tool with Claude

Now you can see MCP in action. When you ask Claude to search Bluesky, watch what happens behind the scenes.

. Enter the following prompt to start a conversation with Claude Code:
+
[source,bash]
----
Search Bluesky for the latest news about Redpanda Data
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you exited the prompt, you can re-enter it by running:

[source,bash]
----
claude Search Bluesky for the latest news about Redpanda Data
----
====

. When Claude prompts you for permissions, select *Yes*:
+
[role="no-wrap no-copy"]
----
> Search Bluesky for the latest news about Redpanda Data

⏺ local:search-bluesky-posts (MCP)(value: "Redpanda")

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Tool use
│   local:search-bluesky-posts(value: "Redpanda") (MCP)
│   Search public Bluesky posts based on a query string.
│ Do you want to proceed?
│ ❯ 1. Yes
│   2. Yes, and don't ask again for local:search-bluesky-posts commands in <path>/my-agent  │
│   3. No, and tell Claude what to do differently (esc)
----
+
This is what happens:
+
--
* Claude analyzes your natural language request.
* Claude identifies the `search-bluesky-posts` tool as the right one to use.
* Claude extracts "Redpanda Data" as the query parameter.
* Claude calls your local MCP server via `mcp-remote`.
* Your Redpanda Connect configuration executes the Bluesky API request.
* Results flow back through the MCP server to Claude.
* Claude synthesizes the results into a conversational response.
--

Here's an example of what the result might look like:

[NOTE]
====
If you change the YAML configuration of your tools, restart the MCP server to pick up the changes.
====

== Stop or disconnect the MCP server

To disconnect or stop the MCP server, press kbd:[Ctrl+C] in the terminal where the server is running. This will gracefully shut down the MCP server process and disconnect any connected clients.

You can also close the terminal window or kill the process using standard OS commands (such as `kill <pid>` on Linux/macOS).

== Summary

You extended Claude's capabilities with a custom tool built from Redpanda Connect components. Claude can now search Bluesky through natural language commands without manual API calls or scripting.

This same pattern works for any workflow you can build with Redpanda Connect: consuming from Kafka topics, transforming data, calling APIs, querying databases, or orchestrating complex data pipelines. Each configuration becomes an AI-consumable tool.

== Troubleshoot

If you encounter issues during this quickstart:

- **Tool not appearing**: Verify `meta.mcp.enabled: true` is set and the tag matches your `--tag` argument.
- **Connection issues**: Ensure the MCP server is running and listening on the expected port.
- **JSON schema errors**: Upgrade to at least version 4.66.1 of Redpanda Connect.
