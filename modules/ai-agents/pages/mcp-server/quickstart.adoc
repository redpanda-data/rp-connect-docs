= Redpanda Connect MCP Server Quickstart
:description: Expose your Redpanda Connect configurations to Claude Code as AI-consumable HTTP endpoints.

This quickstart shows you how to build a Redpanda Connect configuration that searches Bluesky posts using a customizable query. You'll expose this configuration to Claude Code as a tool through an *MCP server*, then ask Claude to perform the search using natural language.

> Find recent posts on Bluesky mentioning Redpanda.

The MCP server makes your local tools *AI-consumable*. It exposes them with metadata that Claude can understand and use to:

- Discover available tools
- Understand required inputs and output format
- Make intelligent, structured HTTP requests

This enables natural-language automation for internal workflows, using your own business logic.

== Prerequisites

You'll need the following to complete this quickstart:

- xref:ROOT:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[Redpanda CLI (`rpk`)]
- At least version 4.56.0 of Redpanda Connect
+
If you need to upgrade, see xref:get-started:upgrade/rpk-upgrade.adoc[].
- link:https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup[Claude Code^]

== Initialize an MCP server project

To get started, create a new MCP server project using the Redpanda CLI.

. Create a directory for your MCP server project:
+
[source,bash]
----
mkdir redpanda-connect-mcp
cd redpanda-connect-mcp
----

. Initialize the MCP server project:
+
[,bash]
----
rpk connect mcp-server init
----
+
This command scaffolds your project with the necessary directories and template YAML files for defining tools and observability resources.
+
[.no-copy]
----
├── o11y
│   ├── metrics.yaml
│   └── tracer.yaml
└── resources
    ├── caches
    │   └── example-cache.yaml
    ├── inputs
    │   └── example-input.yaml
    ├── outputs
    │   └── example-output.yaml
    └── processors
        └── example-processor.yaml
----

== Create a tool definition

Save the following YAML to a file named `resources/processors/bluesky.yaml`.

This tool enables Claude to search public Bluesky posts using natural language.

[source,yaml]
----
label: search-bluesky-posts <1>
try: <2>
  - mutation: |
      root.limit = root.limit.number(25)
      root.limit = [ root.limit, 100 ].min()
      root.limit = [ root.limit, 1 ].max()
      meta query_string = "q=" + root.query.escape_url_query() + "&limit=%v".format(root.limit)
      root = ""
  - http:
      url: "https://public.api.bsky.app/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.searchPosts?${! @query_string }"
      verb: GET
  - mapping: 'root = this.posts'
  - unarchive:
      format: json_array

meta:
  tags: [ example ] <3>
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    description: Search public Bluesky posts based on a query string. <4>
    properties: <5>
      - name: query
        type: string
        required: true
        description: A Lucene-style query string to search posts.
      - name: limit
        type: number
        description: Number of posts to return (1-100). Defaults to 25.
----

This example defines a tool that searches public Bluesky posts based on a query string. The tool:

<1> A unique label for identification. Claude uses this label to discover and call the tool.
<2> A series of processors to build the HTTP request, handle the response, and format the output.
<3> A unique tag (`example`) to control exposure. You can use tags to group related tools or isolate experiments.
<4> A clear description for LLMs helps Claude understand what the tool does.
<5> Structured properties for inputs like `query` and `limit`.

== Start the MCP server

Start the MCP server to expose the tool over HTTP:

[source,bash]
----
rpk connect mcp-server --address localhost:4195 --tag example
----

You should see output like this:

[.no-copy]
----
time=2025-06-27T15:20:27.976+01:00 level=INFO msg="Registering processor tool" label=search-bluesky-posts
time=2025-06-27T15:20:27.978+01:00 level=INFO msg="Successfully loaded Redpanda license" expires_at=2035-06-25T15:20:27+01:00 license_org="" license_type="open source"
----

This command creates an MCP server listening on `localhost:4195`, and makes your tool discoverable to AI agents.

:tip-caption: Limit exposure

[TIP]
====
Only tools with the specified `--tag` are exposed. This helps you:

- Keep experiments isolated
- Avoid exposing sensitive functionality accidentally
- Create sets of tools that are relevant to specific agents or workflows
====

:tip-caption: Tip

== Connect Claude Code to your MCP server


To connect Claude Code to your MCP server, you need to expose a live event stream that Claude can consume. This is done using the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote[`mcp-remote` utility^], which bridges your local service to Claude's MCP interface. `mcp-remote` is a lightweight bridge that turns any streaming HTTP endpoint into a source of MCP-compatible messages.

. To install `mcp-remote`, run:
+
[,bash]
----
claude mcp add local -- npx mcp-remote http://localhost:4195/sse
----
+
You should see output like this:
+
[.no-copy]
----
Added stdio MCP server local with command: npx mcp-remote http://localhost:4195/sse to local config
----

. Verify that the local input channel is set up correctly by running:
+
[source,bash]
----
claude /mcp
----
+
You should see an entry for `local`.

. Press *Enter* until you see the tools list.
+
[.no-copy,role="no-wrap"]
----
Tools for local (1 tools)
│ ❯ 1. search-bluesky-posts
----

. Press *Esc* until you return to the main prompt.


== Write a prompt that uses the tool

To use the `search-bluesky-posts` tool in Claude, write a prompt that includes a natural language request.

. Enter the following prompt to start a conversation with Claude Code:
+
[source,bash]
----
Search Bluesky for the latest news about Redpanda Data
----
+
[TIP]
====
If you exited the prompt, you can re-enter it by running:

[source,bash]
----
claude Search Bluesky for the latest news about Redpanda Data
----
====

. When Claude prompts you for permissions, select *Yes*:
+
[role="no-wrap no-copy"]
----
> Search Bluesky for the latest news about Redpanda Data

⏺ local:search-bluesky-posts (MCP)(value: "Redpanda")

╭─────────────────────────────────────────────
│ Tool use
│   local:search-bluesky-posts(value: "Redpanda") (MCP)
│   Search public Bluesky posts based on a query string.
│ Do you want to proceed?
│ ❯ 1. Yes
│   2. Yes, and don't ask again for local:search-bluesky-posts commands in /Users/jakecahill/Documents/my-agent  │
│   3. No, and tell Claude what to do differently (esc)
----

Claude will:

. Fill in the `query` property
. Send an HTTP request to your local MCP server
. Return the result in conversation

If you change the YAML configuration of your tools, make sure to restart the MCP server to pick up the changes.

Here's an example of what the result might look like:

== Stop or disconnect the MCP server

To disconnect or stop the MCP server, press kbd::[Ctrl+C] in the terminal where the server is running. This will gracefully shut down the MCP server process and disconnect any connected clients.

You can also close the terminal window or kill the process using standard OS commands (such as `kill <pid>` on Linux/macOS).

== Next steps

Try adding more tools under the same `example` tag to expand Claude Code's capabilities. See xref:ai-agents:mcp-server/developer-guide.adoc[].

View the xref:components:about.adoc[full catalog of connectors] you can use to build more tools.

NOTE: You can connect any MCP client to your MCP server. For a list of example clients, see the link:https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients[MCP documentation^].
