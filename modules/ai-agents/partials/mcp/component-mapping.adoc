=== How components map to MCP tools

Each MCP tool is implemented as a single Redpanda Connect component. The component type determines what the tool can do.

The following table shows which component types are available and their purposes:

| Transforms, validates, or computes data. Calls external APIs. Returns results to the AI client.

ifndef::env-cloud[]

| Writes data to external systems (Redpanda topics, databases, APIs). Can include processors for transformation before writing.

ifndef::env-cloud[]

| Reads data from external systems. Returns the read data to the AI client.

| Stores and retrieves data for use by other tools.
|===

Most MCP tools are processors. Use outputs when you need to write data. Use inputs when you need to read from external data sources.
