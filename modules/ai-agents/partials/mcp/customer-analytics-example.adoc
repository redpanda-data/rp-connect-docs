== Example: Customer analytics tool

Here's how you might expose a customer analytics pipeline as an MCP tool:

[source,yaml]
----
label: analyze_customer_orders
processors:
  - label: fetch_customer_data
    sql_select:
      driver: "postgres"
ifdef::env-cloud[]
      dsn: "${secrets.POSTGRES_DSN}"
endif::[]
ifndef::env-cloud[]
      dsn: "${POSTGRES_DSN}"
endif::[]
      table: "orders"
      where: "customer_id = ? AND created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'"
      args_mapping: 'root = [this.customer_id]'

  - label: calculate_metrics
    mutation: |
      root = {
        "customer_id": this.0.customer_id,
        "total_orders": this.length(),
        "total_spent": this.map_each(o -> o.total).sum(),
        "avg_order_value": this.map_each(o -> o.total).mean(),
        "last_order_date": this.map_each(o -> o.created_at).max()
      }

meta:
  mcp:
    enabled: true
    description: "Analyze a customer's order history and spending patterns over the last 30 days"
    properties:
      - name: customer_id
        type: string
        description: "Customer ID to analyze"
        required: true
----

This tool can be invoked by an AI assistant with prompts like "analyze the order history for customer ID 12345" without needing to know the underlying SQL or processing logic.
