=== MCP tools compared to pipelines

An MCP tool is a single Redpanda Connect component that executes on demand when called by an AI client. Unlike a traditional Redpanda Connect pipeline, MCP tools follow a request/response pattern similar to calling a function.

The tool starts, runs, and completes for each invocation. There is no persistent state between calls.

MCP tools are not pipelines.

In Redpanda Connect, a pipeline typically means a continuous data flow where data streams from an input, through processors, to an output. The pipeline runs indefinitely, processing many messages over time.
