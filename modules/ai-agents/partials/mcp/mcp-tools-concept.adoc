Before building MCP tools, establish a clear mental model of how they work. This section explains what MCP tools are, how they differ from pipelines, and how Redpanda Connect components map to tools.

=== What are MCP tools

An MCP tool is a single Redpanda Connect component that executes on demand when called by an AI client. The execution follows a request/response pattern similar to calling a function.

Each tool invocation follows this sequence:

. A tool receives JSON input from the AI client.
. The tool executes its logic once.
. The tool returns a structured response.
. The AI client uses the response to continue its task.

The tool starts, runs, and completes for each invocation. There is no persistent state between calls.

MCP tools are not pipelines.

In Redpanda Connect, a pipeline typically means a continuous data flow where data streams from an input, through processors, to an output. The pipeline runs indefinitely, processing many messages over time.
