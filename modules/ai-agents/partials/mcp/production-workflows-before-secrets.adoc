== Production workflows and observability

Build enterprise-grade tools with error handling, validation, multi-step workflows, and monitoring.

=== Parameter validation and type coercion

Always validate and coerce input parameters to ensure your tools are robust:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$best-practices/production-workflows/param-validation.yaml[tags=param-validation]
----

=== Dynamic configuration

Build tools that adapt their behavior based on input parameters:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$best-practices/production-workflows/dynamic-config.yaml[tags=dynamic-config]
----

=== Error handling and fallbacks

Implement error handling to make your tools reliable:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$best-practices/production-workflows/error-fallbacks.yaml[tags=error-fallbacks]
----

=== Conditional processing

Build tools that branch based on input or data characteristics:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$best-practices/production-workflows/conditional-processing.yaml[tags=conditional-processing]
