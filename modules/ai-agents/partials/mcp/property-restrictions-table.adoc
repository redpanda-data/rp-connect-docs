Different component types have different property capabilities when exposed as MCP tools:

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Component Type | Property Support | Details

| `input`
| Only supports `count` property
| AI clients can specify how many messages to read, but you cannot define custom properties.

| `cache`
| No custom properties
| Properties are hardcoded to `key` and `value` for cache operations.

| `output`
| Custom properties supported
| AI sees properties as an array for batch operations: `[{prop1, prop2}, {prop1, prop2}]`.

| `processor`
| Custom properties supported
| You can define any properties needed for data processing operations.
