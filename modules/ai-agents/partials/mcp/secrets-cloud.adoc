=== Secrets and credentials

Securely handle multiple credentials and API keys.

Here is an example of using an API key secret.

. Create a secret in the xref:develop:connect/configuration/secret-management.adoc[Secrets Store] with name `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` and your API key as the value.

. Reference the secret in your YAML configuration:
+
[source,yaml]
----
processors:
  - label: call_external_api
    http:
      url: "https://api.example.com/data"
      verb: GET
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer ${secrets.EXTERNAL_API_KEY}"  # <1>
        Accept: "application/json"
----
+
<1> The secret is injected at runtime. Never store the actual API key in your YAML configuration. The actual secret value never appears in your configuration files or logs.
