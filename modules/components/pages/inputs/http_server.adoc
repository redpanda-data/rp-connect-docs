======

If the `address` config field is left blank the xref:components:http/about.adoc[service-wide HTTP server] will be used.

The field `rate_limit` allows you to specify an optional xref:components:rate_limits/about.adoc[`rate_limit` resource], which will be applied to each HTTP request made and each websocket payload received.

When the rate limit is breached HTTP requests will have a 429 response returned with a Retry-After header. Websocket payloads will be dropped and an optional response payload will be sent as per `ws_rate_limit_message`.

== Responses

It's possible to return a response for each message received using xref:guides:sync_responses.adoc[synchronous responses]. When doing so you can customize headers with the `sync_response` field `headers`, which can also use xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation] in the value based on the response message contents.

== Endpoints

The following fields specify endpoints that are registered for sending messages, and support path parameters of the form `/\{foo}`, which are added to ingested messages as metadata. A path ending in `/` will match against all extensions of that path:

=== `path` (defaults to `/post`)

This endpoint expects POST requests where the entire request body is consumed as a single message.

If the request contains a multipart `content-type` header as per https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html[RFC1341^] then the multiple parts are consumed as a batch of messages, where each body part is a message of the batch.

=== `ws_path` (defaults to `/post/ws`)

Creates a websocket connection, where payloads received on the socket are passed through the pipeline as a batch of one message.


[CAUTION]
.Endpoint caveats
====
Components within a Redpanda Connect config will register their respective endpoints in a non-deterministic order. This means that establishing precedence of endpoints that are registered via multiple `http_server` inputs or outputs (either within brokers or from cohabiting streams) is not possible in a predictable way.

This ambiguity makes it difficult to ensure that paths which are both a subset of a path registered by a separate component, and end in a slash (`/`) and will therefore match against all extensions of that path, do not prevent the more specific path from matching against requests.

It is therefore recommended that you ensure paths of separate components do not collide unless they are explicitly non-competing.

For example, if you were to deploy two separate `http_server` inputs, one with a path `/foo/` and the other with a path `/foo/bar`, it would not be possible to ensure that the path `/foo/` does not swallow requests made to `/foo/bar`.
====

You may specify an optional `ws_welcome_message`, which is a static payload to be sent to all clients once a websocket connection is first established.

It's also possible to specify a `ws_rate_limit_message`, which is a static payload to be sent to clients that have triggered the servers rate limit.

== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```text
- http_server_user_agent
- http_server_request_path
- http_server_verb
- http_server_remote_ip
- All headers (only first values are taken)
- All query parameters
- All path parameters
- All cookies
```

If HTTPS is enabled, the following fields are added as well:
```text
- http_server_tls_version
- http_server_tls_subject
- http_server_tls_cipher_suite
```

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].

=== Headers

Request headers are available as metadata and use the HTTP header name with no additional prefix as a key. During processing, Redpanda Connect changes the format of the header name, as in the following example:
```text
x-api-key available as metadata("X-Api-Key")
```
