Uses https://docs.ockam.io/[Ockam^] to decrypt and read end-to-end encrypted messages from Kafka topics. You can write encrypted messages using the `ockam_kafka` output or by https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-kafka-inlet-create.html[creating a Kafka Portal Inlet^] using Ockam Command.

https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/secure-channels[Ockam Secure Channels] guarantee that topic data can only be consumed by authenticated and authorized consumers, and that the data cannot be leaked or or tampered with in-flight between the producer and consumer. Neither Kafka brokers, service providers nor other components can see or manipulate the messages.

NOTE: You can use Ockam to encrypt whole messages, or specific fields in a message. 

Introduced in version 4.33.0.

== Fields

=== `kafka.seed_brokers`

A list of broker addresses to connect to (optional). List items that contain commas are expanded into multiple addresses.

*Type*: `array`
```yml
# Examples
seed_brokers:
  - localhost:9092
seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092
  - bar:9092
seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092,bar:9092
```
=== `kafka.topics`

A list of topics to consume from (required). You can list multiple comma-separated topics in a single element.

If you specify a `consumer_group`, partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Otherwise, all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, add a colon after the topic name to set the explicit partitions to consume. For example, `foo:0` consumes the partition `0` of the topic `foo`. This syntax also supports ranges. For example, `foo:0-10` consumes all partitions from `0` through to `10` inclusively.

Finally, add another colon after the partition to set an explicit offset to consume from. For example, `foo:0:10` consumes the partition `0` of the topic `foo` starting from the offset `10`. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from.

*Type*: `array`

```yml
# Examples
topics:
  - foo
  - bar
topics:
  - things.*
topics:
  - foo,bar
topics:
  - foo:0
  - bar:1
  - bar:3
topics:
  - foo:0,bar:1,bar:3
topics:
  - foo:0-5
```

=== `kafka.regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics are interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. Set this value to `false` when explicit partitions are specified for topics.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `kafka.consumer_group`

Assign a consumer group for the processing of messages (optional). When this value is set:

* Partitions of specified topics are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group. 
* Partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name.

Consumer groups are not supported when explicit partitions to consume from are specified in the `topics` field.

*Type*: `string`

=== `kafka.client_id`

An identifier for the client connection.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `benthos`

=== `kafka.rack_id`

A rack identifier for this client.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `kafka.checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages that are processed in parallel inside the same partition before back pressure is applied. 

When a message with a specific offset is delivered to the output, the offset is only committed when all messages of previous offsets have also been delivered. This behavior ensures at-least-once delivery guarantees. However, in the event of crashes or server faults, it also increases the likelihood of duplicates. To decrease this risk, reduce the `checkpoint_limit` value.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1024`

=== `kafka.auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of message rejections is persistent, replaying them may cause back pressure. 

Set this value to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling automatic replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams, as the original shape of the data is immediately discarded upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `kafka.commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `kafka.start_from_oldest`

Whether to consume from the oldest available offset. Otherwise, messages are consumed from the latest offset. This setting is applied when creating a new consumer group or the saved offset no longer exists.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `kafka.metadata_max_age`

The maximum period of time after which metadata is refreshed.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5m`


=== `kafka.tls`

Override system defaults with custom TLS settings.

*Type*: `object`

=== `kafka.tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `kafka.tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `kafka.tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

Requires version 3.45.0 or newer

=== `kafka.tls.root_cas`

Specify a root certificate authority to use (optional). This is a string that represents a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `kafka.tls.root_cas_file`

Specify the path to a root certificate authority file (optional). This is a file, often with a `.pem` extension, which contains a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `kafka.tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate, specify either the fields `cert` and `key` or `cert_file` and `key_file`.

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar
client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `kafka.tls.client_certs[].password`

The plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format. 

WARNING: The `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm does not authenticate ciphertext, and is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that may allow an attacker to recover the plain text password.

include::components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples
password: foo
password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

=== `kafka.sasl`

If the first mechanism fails, the client picks the first supported mechanism. If the broker does not support any client mechanisms, all connections fail.

*Type*: `array`

```yml
# Examples
sasl:
  - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: bar
    username: foo
```

You can generate a new ticket using the https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-project-ticket.html[`ockam project ticket` command^].

*Type*: `string`

=== `identity_name`

The name of the https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-identity.html[Ockam identity] to use. If this value is not provided, the default Ockam identity is automatically generated and used (optional).

*Type*: `string`

=== `allow`

Use in conjunction with the `route_to_kafka_outlet` field to specify an access control policy for the Kafka Portal Outlet.

For example, setting this value to `kafka_us_east` forces the Kafka Outlet to present an Ockam credential, which confirms that the Outlet has the attribute `kafka_us_east=true`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `self`

=== `route_to_kafka_outlet`

The route to reach the Kafka Portal Outlet of your Ockam portal. For example, `/project/default`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `self`

=== `allow_producer`

Specify an access control policy for producers.

For example, setting this value to `orders_producer` forces the producer to present an Ockam credential, which confirms that the producer has the attribute `orders_producer=true`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `self`

=== `relay`

Make the Ockam node accessible through a relay with the supplied name (optional). 

For example, setting this value to `orders_consumer` would require you to set the `route_to_consumer` on any producer to `/project/default/service/forward_to_orders_consumer/secure/api`.


*Type*: `string`

=== `node_address`

The TCP listening address of the Ockam node.

*Type*: `string`
