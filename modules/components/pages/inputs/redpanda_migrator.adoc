======

The `redpanda_migrator` input:

* Reads a batch of messages from a Kafka broker.
* Attempts to create all selected topics along with their associated ACLs in the broker that the output points to, identified by the label specified in `output_resource`.
* Waits for the `redpanda_migrator` output to acknowledge the writes before updating the Kafka consumer group offset.

Specify a consumer group for this input to consume one or more topics and automatically balance the topic partitions across any other connected clients with the same consumer group. Otherwise, topics are consumed in their entirety or with explicit partitions.

== Metrics

This input emits a `input_redpanda_migrator_lag` metric with `topic` and `partition` labels for each consumed topic.

== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

```text
- kafka_key
- kafka_topic
- kafka_partition
- kafka_offset
- kafka_lag
- kafka_timestamp_unix
- kafka_tombstone_message
- All record headers
```


== Fields

=== `seed_brokers`

A list of broker addresses to connect to in order. Use commas to separate multiple addresses in a single list item.

*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

seed_brokers:
  - localhost:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092
  - bar:9092

seed_brokers:
  - foo:9092,bar:9092
```

=== `topics`

A list of topics to consume from. Use commas to separate multiple topics in a single element.

When a `consumer_group` is specified, partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Otherwise, all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, you can specify explicit partitions to consume by using a colon after the topic name. For example, `foo:0` would consume the partition `0` of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges. For example, `foo:0-10` would consume partitions `0` through to `10` inclusive.

It is also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition. For example, `foo:0:10` would consume the partition `0` of the topic `foo` starting from the offset `10`. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

topics:
  - foo
  - bar

topics:
  - things.*

topics:
  - foo,bar

topics:
  - foo:0
  - bar:1
  - bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0,bar:1,bar:3

topics:
  - foo:0-5
```

=== `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics are interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions, this field must remain set to `false`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `consumer_group`

An optional consumer group. When specified, the partitions of specified topics are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group, and partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name. Consumer groups are not supported when explicit partitions are specified to consume from in the `topics` field.


*Type*: `string`


=== `client_id`

An identifier for the client connection.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"benthos"`

=== `rack_id`

A rack identifier for this client.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `batch_size`

The maximum number of messages that can accumulate in each batch.


*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1024`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of rejections is persistent, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `"5s"`

=== `start_from_oldest`

Determines whether to consume from the oldest available offset, otherwise messages are consumed from the latest offset. This setting is applied when creating a new consumer group or the saved offset no longer exists.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `tls`

Override system defaults with custom TLS settings.


*Type*: `object`


=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.


*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or newer
endif::[]

=== `tls.root_cas`

Specify a certificate authority to use (optional). This is a string that represents a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

Specify the path to a root certificate authority file (optional). This is a file, often with a `.pem` extension, which contains a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
```

=== `tls.client_certs`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate specify values for either the `cert` and `key` fields, or `cert_file` and `key_file` fields.


*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

```yml
# Examples

client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key
```

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

The path of a certificate to use.


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding Oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

```yml
# Examples

password: foo

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
```

=== `sasl`

Specify one or more methods of SASL authentication. SASL mechanisms are tried in order. If the broker supports the first mechanism, all connections use that mechanism. If the first mechanism fails, the client picks the first supported mechanism. Connections fail if the broker does not support any client mechanisms.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

sasl:
  - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: bar
    username: foo
```

=== `sasl[].mechanism`

The SASL mechanism to use.


*Type*: `string`

Configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy] that applies to individual topic partitions in order to batch messages together before flushing them for processing. Batching can be beneficial for performance as well as useful for windowed processing, and doing so this way preserves the ordering of topic partitions.


*Type*: `object`


```yml
# Examples

batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

batching:

```yml
# Examples

check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
```

=== `batching.processors`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch. All resulting messages are flushed as a single batch. Splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.


*Type*: `array`


```yml
# Examples

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines

processors:
  - archive:
