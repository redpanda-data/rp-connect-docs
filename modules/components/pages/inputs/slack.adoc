:type: input

component_type_dropdown::[]

Connects to Slack using https://api.slack.com/apis/socket-mode[Socket Mode^], and can receive events, interactions (automated and user-initiated), and slash commands.

This input is useful for:

- Building bots that can query or write data.
- Sending events to data warehouses.

You could also try pairing this input with Redpanda Connect's AI processors, which use the prefixes `cohere`, `openai`, and `ollama`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Introduced in version 4.51.0.

# Common configuration fields, showing default values

== Metadata

Each message emitted from this input has an `@type` metadata flag to indicate the event type, either `"events_api"`, `"interactions"`, or `"slash_commands"`.

== Fields

=== `app_token`

The app-level token to use to authenticate and connect to Slack.

*Type*: `string`

=== `bot_token`

Your Slack bot user's OAuth token, which must have the https://api.slack.com/scopes/connections:write[`connections.write` scope^] to access your Slack app's https://api.slack.com/methods/apps.connections.open[Socket Mode WebSocket URL^].

*Type*: `string`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of rejections is persistent, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams, as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

== Examples

The following pipeline reposts messages created by a Slack app to the same thread in the same channel, adding `ECHO:` to the original message text. All hidden or non-message events, and any activity originating from the Slack bot, are excluded.

```yml
input:
  slack:
    app_token: "${APP_TOKEN:xapp-demo}"
    bot_token: "${BOT_TOKEN:xoxb-demo}"
    auto_replay_nacks: true
pipeline:
  processors:
    # Ignore hidden or non-message events, and messages sent by the bot.
    - mutation: |
        if this.event.type != "message" || (this.event.hidden | false) {
          root = deleted()
        }
        if this.authorizations.any(auth -> auth.user_id == this.event.user) {
          root = deleted()
        }
output:
  slack_post:
    bot_token: "${BOT_TOKEN:xoxb-demo}"
    channel_id: "${!this.event.channel}"
    thread_ts: "${!this.event.ts}"
    text: "ECHO: ${!this.event.text}"
```
