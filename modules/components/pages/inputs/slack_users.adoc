== Fields

=== `bot_token`

Your https://api.slack.com/concepts/token-types[Slack bot user's OAuth token^], which must have the https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read[`users.read` scope^] to access your Slack organization.

*Type*: `string`

=== `team_id`

The encoded ID of a Slack team by which to filter the list of returned users, which you can get from the https://api.slack.com/methods/team.info[`team.info` Slack API method^]. If `team_id` is left empty, users from all teams within the organization are returned.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of rejections is persistent, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams, as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`
