Prints aggregated metrics through the logger.

```yml
include::components:example$common/metrics/logger.yaml[]

```

Prints each metric produced by Redpanda Connect as a log event (level `info` by default) during shutdown, and optionally on an interval.

This metrics type is useful for debugging pipelines when you only have access to the logger output and not the service-wide server. Otherwise it's recommended that you use either the `prometheus` or `json_api` types.
