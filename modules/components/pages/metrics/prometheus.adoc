== Push gateway

The field `push_url` is optional and when set will trigger a push of metrics to a https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/[Prometheus Push Gateway^] once Redpanda Connect shuts down. It is also possible to specify a `push_interval` which results in periodic pushes.

The Push Gateway is useful for when Redpanda Connect instances are short lived. Do not include the "/metrics/jobs/..." path in the push URL.

If the Push Gateway requires HTTP Basic Authentication it can be configured with `push_basic_auth`.
