== Metadata

Message metadata is added to each AMQP message as string annotations. To control which metadata keys are added, use the `metadata` configuration field.

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.
