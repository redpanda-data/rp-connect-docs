This output allows you to write vectors to a CyborgDB encrypted index. CyborgDB provides
end-to-end encrypted vector storage with automatic dimension detection and index optimization.

All vector data is encrypted client-side before being sent to the server, ensuring complete
data privacy. The encryption key never leaves your infrastructure.
