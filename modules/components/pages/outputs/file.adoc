Writes messages to files on disk based on a chosen codec.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
output:
  label: ""
  file:
    path: /tmp/data.txt # No default (required)
    codec: lines
```

Messages can be written to different files by using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions] in the path field. However, only one file is ever open at a given time, and therefore when the path changes the previously open file is closed.
