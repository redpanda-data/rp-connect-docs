Each file is written with the path specified with the 'path' field, in order to have a different path for each object you should use function interpolations described xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[here].

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.
