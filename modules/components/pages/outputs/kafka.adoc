The `kafka` output writes a batch of messages to Kafka brokers and waits for acknowledgement before propagating any acknowledgements back to the input.

The configuration field `ack_replicas` determines whether Redpanda Connect waits for acknowledgement from all replicas or just a single broker.

Both the `key` and `topic` fields can be dynamically set using function interpolations described in xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[Bloblang queries].

xref:configuration:metadata.adoc[Metadata] will be added to each message sent as headers (version 0.11+), but can be restricted using the field <<metadata, `metadata`>>.

== Strict ordering and retries

When strict ordering is required for messages written to topic partitions it is important to ensure that both the field `max_in_flight` is set to `1` and that the field `retry_as_batch` is set to `true`.

You must also ensure that failed batches are never rerouted back to the same output. This can be done by setting the field `max_retries` to `0` and `backoff.max_elapsed_time` to empty, which will apply back pressure indefinitely until the batch is sent successfully.

However, this also means that manual intervention will eventually be required in cases where the batch cannot be sent due to configuration problems such as an incorrect `max_msg_bytes` estimate. A less strict but automated alternative would be to route failed batches to a dead letter queue using a xref:components:outputs/fallback.adoc[`fallback` broker], but this would allow subsequent batches to be delivered in the meantime whilst those failed batches are dealt with.

== Troubleshooting

If you're seeing issues writing to or reading from Kafka with this component then it's worth trying out the newer xref:components:outputs/kafka_franz.adoc[`kafka_franz` output].

- I'm seeing logs that report `Failed to connect to kafka: kafka: client has run out of available brokers to talk to (Is your cluster reachable?)`, but the brokers are definitely reachable.

Unfortunately this error message will appear for a wide range of connection problems even when the broker endpoint can be reached. Double check your authentication configuration and also ensure that you have <<tlsenabled, enabled TLS>> if applicable.

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].
