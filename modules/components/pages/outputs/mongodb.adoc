== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight, in parallel, for improved performance. You can tune the maximum number of in flight messages (or message batches) using the `max_in_flight` field.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. For more information, see xref:configuration:batching.adoc[Message Batching].
