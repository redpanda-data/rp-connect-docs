Uses https://docs.ockam.io/[Ockam^] to encrypt and write end-to-end encrypted messages to a Kafka topic. You can read encrypted messages using the `ockam_kafka` input or by https://command.ockam.io/manual/ockam-kafka-inlet-create.html[creating a Kafka Portal Inlet^] using Ockam Command.

https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command/secure-channels[Ockam Secure Channels^] guarantee that consumers of topics only receive data from authenticated and authorized producers, and that the data has not been leaked or tampered with in-flight. Neither Kafka brokers, service providers nor other components can see or manipulate the messages.

NOTE: You can use Ockam to encrypt whole messages, or specific fields in a message. 

Introduced in version 4.33.0.
