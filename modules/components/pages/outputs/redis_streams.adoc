======

It's possible to specify a maximum length of the target stream by setting it to a value greater than 0, in which case this cap is applied only when Redis is able to remove a whole macro node, for efficiency.

Redis stream entries are key/value pairs, as such it is necessary to specify the key to be set to the body of the message. All metadata fields of the message will also be set as key/value pairs, if there is a key collision between a metadata item and the body then the body takes precedence.

== Performance

This output benefits from sending multiple messages in flight in parallel for improved performance. You can tune the max number of in flight messages (or message batches) with the field `max_in_flight`.

This output benefits from sending messages as a batch for improved performance. Batches can be formed at both the input and output level. You can find out more xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].
