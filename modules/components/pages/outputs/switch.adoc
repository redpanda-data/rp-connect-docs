The switch output type allows you to route messages to different outputs based on their contents.


[tabs]
======
Common::

```yml
include::components:example$common/outputs/switch.yaml[]
```

--
Advanced::

```yml
include::components:example$advanced/outputs/switch.yaml[]
```

======

Messages that do not pass the check of a single output case are effectively dropped. In order to prevent this outcome set the field <<strict_mode, `strict_mode`>> to `true`, in which case messages that do not pass at least one case are considered failed and will be nacked and/or reprocessed depending on your input.
