== Throughput statistics

This processor logs the following rolling statistics at a <<interval,configurable interval>> to help you to understand the current performance of your pipeline:

- The number of messages processed per second.
- The number of bytes processed per second (optional).

For example:

```bash
INFO rolling stats: 1 msg/sec, 407 B/sec
```

When the processor shuts down, it also logs a summary of the number and size of messages processed during its lifetime. For example:

```bash
INFO total stats: 1.00186 msg/sec, 425 B/sec 
```
