component_type_dropdown::[]


Executes a xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang] mapping on messages.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
label: ""
bloblang: ""
```

Bloblang is a powerful language that enables a wide range of mapping, transformation and filtering tasks. For more information see xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[].

If your mapping is large and you'd prefer for it to live in a separate file then you can execute a mapping directly from a file with the expression `from "<path>"`, where the path must be absolute, or relative from the location that Redpanda Connect is executed from.

== Component rename

This processor was recently renamed to the xref:components:processors/mapping.adoc[`mapping` processor] in order to make the purpose of the processor more prominent. It is still valid to use the existing `bloblang` name but eventually it will be deprecated and replaced by the new name in example configs.

== Error handling

Bloblang mappings can fail, in which case the message remains unchanged, errors are logged, and the message is flagged as having failed, allowing you to use
xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[standard processor error handling patterns].

However, Bloblang itself also provides powerful ways of ensuring your mappings do not fail by specifying desired fallback behavior, which you can read about in xref:guides:bloblang/about#error-handling.adoc[Error handling].
