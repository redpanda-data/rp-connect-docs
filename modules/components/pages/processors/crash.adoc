= crash
:type: processor
:categories: ["Utility"]

Stops the current pipeline process with a fatal log message. You can use xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolations] to define the log message, including the message contents and metadata that caused the fatal error.

```yml
# Configuration fields, showing default values
label: ""
crash: "" # No default (required)
```

This processor is useful for halting pipeline execution in the event of critical failures. For example:

- To detect silent or unrecoverable errors.
- To prevent data corruption caused by unexpected data formats.
- To notify observability tools, such as monitoring dashboards, for immediate action.
