Parses messages into a structured format by attempting to apply a list of Grok expressions, the first expression to result in at least one value replaces the original message with a JSON object containing the values.

Common::

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
label: ""
grok:
  expressions: [] # No default (required)
  pattern_definitions: {}
  pattern_paths: []
```

Advanced::

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
label: ""
grok:
  expressions: [] # No default (required)
  pattern_definitions: {}
  pattern_paths: []
  named_captures_only: true
  use_default_patterns: true
  remove_empty_values: true
```

Type hints within patterns are respected, therefore with the pattern `%\{WORD:first},%{INT:second:int}` and a payload of `foo,1` the resulting payload would be `\{"first":"foo","second":1}`.

== Performance

This processor currently uses the https://golang.org/s/re2syntax[Go RE2^] regular expression engine, which is guaranteed to run in time linear to the size of the input. However, this property often makes it less performant than PCRE based implementations of grok. For more information, see https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html.
