This processor sends a text description and other attributes, such as a voice type and format to the OpenAI API, which generates audio. By default, the processor submits the entire payload of each message as a string, unless you use the `input` configuration field to customize it.

To learn more about turning text into spoken audio, see the https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech[OpenAI API documentation^].
