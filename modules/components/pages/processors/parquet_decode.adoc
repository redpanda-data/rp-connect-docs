Decodes https://parquet.apache.org/docs/[Parquet files^] into a batch of structured messages.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Introduced in version 4.4.0.

```yml
# Configuration fields, showing default values
label: ""
parquet_decode:
  handle_logical_types: v1
```

== Fields

=== `handle_logical_types`
 
Set to `v2` to enable enhanced decoding of logical types, or keep the default value (`v1`) to ignore logical type metadata when decoding values.

In Parquet format, logical types are represented using standard physical types along with metadata that provides additional context. For example, UUIDs are stored as a `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY` physical type, but the schema metadata identifies them as UUIDs. By enabling `v2`, this processor uses the metadata descriptions of logical types to produce more meaningful values during decoding.

NOTE: For backward compatibility, this field enables logical-type handling for the specified Parquet format version, and all earlier versions. When creating new pipelines, Redpanda recommends that you use the newest documented version.

*Type*: `string`
 
*Default*: `v1`

Options:
 
[cols="2,8"]
|===
| Option | Description
 
| `v1`
| No special handling of logical types.

| `v2`
a| Logical types with enhanced decoding:

* `TIMESTAMP`: Decodes as an RFC3339 string describing the time. If the `isAdjustedToUTC` flag is set to `true` in the Parquet file, the time zone is set to UTC. If the flag is set to `false`, the time zone is set to local time.

* `UUID`: Decodes as a string: `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff`.

== Examples

=== Reading Parquet files from AWS S3

In this example, a pipeline consumes Parquet files as soon as they are uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket. The pipeline listens to an SQS queue for upload events, and uses the `to_the_end` scanner to read the files into memory in full. The `parquet_decode` processor then decodes each file into a batch of structured messages. Finally, the data is written to local files in newline-delimited JSON format.

```yaml
input:
  aws_s3:
    bucket: TODO
    prefix: files/
    scanner:
      to_the_end: {}
    sqs:
      url: TODO
  processors:
    - parquet_decode:
        handle_logical_types: v2
output:
  file:
    codec: lines
    path: './files/${! meta("s3_key") }.jsonl'
```
