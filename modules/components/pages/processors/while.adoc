A processor that checks a xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] against each batch of messages and executes child processors on them for as long as the query resolves to true.

Common::

```yml
# Common config fields, showing default values
label: ""
while:
  at_least_once: false
  check: ""
  processors: [] # No default (required)
```

Advanced::
+
--

```yml
# All config fields, showing default values
label: ""
while:
  at_least_once: false
  max_loops: 0
  check: ""
  processors: [] # No default (required)
```

======

The field `at_least_once`, if true, ensures that the child processors are always executed at least one time (like a do .. while loop.)

The field `max_loops`, if greater than zero, caps the number of loops for a message batch to this value.

If following a loop execution the number of messages in a batch is reduced to zero the loop is exited regardless of the condition result. If following a loop execution there are more than 1 message batches the query is checked against the first batch only.

The conditions of this processor are applied across entire message batches. You can find out more about batching xref:configuration:batching.adoc[in this doc].
