== Avro JSON format

This scanner creates documents formatted as https://avro.apache.org/docs/current/specification/[Avro JSON^] when decoding with Avro schemas. In this format, the value of a union is encoded in JSON as follows:

- If the union's type is `null`, it is encoded as a JSON `null`.
- Otherwise, the union is encoded as a JSON object with one name/value pair. The `"name"` is the type's name and the `"value"` is the recursively encoded value. For Avro's named types (record, fixed or enum), the user-specified name is used. For other types, the type name is used.

For example, the union schema `["null","string","Transaction"]`, where `Transaction` is a record name, would encode:

- The `null` as a JSON `null`
- The string `"a"` as `{"string": "a"}`
- A `Transaction` instance as `{"Transaction": {...}}`, where `{...}` indicates the JSON encoding of a `Transaction` instance

Alternatively, you can create documents in https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/linkedin/goavro/v2#NewCodecForStandardJSONFull[standard/raw JSON format^] by setting the field <<raw_json,`raw_json`>> to `true`.
