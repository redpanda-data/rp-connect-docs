:description: Consumes a stream of one or more JSON elements within a top level array.

*Introduced in version 4.65.0.*
endif::[]

Consumes a stream of one or more JSON elements within a top level array. This scanner is useful for:

- Processing exports from systems that generate a JSON array as the top-level JSON structure (for example, logs, bulk exports, etc).
- Efficiently breaking up large files with many objects into individual events/messages.

Suppose you have a file `events.json`:

.`events.json`
[,json]
----
[
  {"event": "login", "user": "alice"},
  {"event": "logout", "user": "bob"},
  {"event": "purchase", "user": "carol", "amount": 42}
]
----

The configuration to process this file is:

```yaml
input:
  file:
    paths: [ "./events.json" ]
    scanner:
      json_array: {}
```

Result: Each event in the array is processed as a separate message.

== Requirements

The `json_array` scanner expects the input to be a single JSON array, where each array element is a JSON object or value.

== Fields

The `json_array` scanner has no required fields. You declare it as `{}` in your config.

```yaml
json_array: {}
```

// end::single-source[]
