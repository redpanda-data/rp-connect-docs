Select a child scanner dynamically for source data based on factors such as the filename.

```yml
# Config fields, showing default values
switch: [] # No default (required)
```

This scanner outlines a list of potential child scanner candidates to be chosen, and for each source of data the first candidate to pass will be selected. A candidate without any conditions acts as a catch-all and will pass for every source, it is recommended to always have a catch-all scanner at the end of your list. If a given source of data does not pass a candidate an error is returned and the data is rejected.
