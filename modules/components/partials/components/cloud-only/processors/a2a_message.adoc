This processor enables Redpanda Connect pipelines to communicate with A2A protocol agents. Currently only JSON-RPC transport is supported.

The processor sends a message to the agent and polls for task completion. The agent's response
is returned as the processor output.

For more information about the A2A protocol, see https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/specification
