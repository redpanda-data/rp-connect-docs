:description: Receive messages delivered over HTTP.

component_type_dropdown::[]

The `gateway` input is a Cloud-only component that receives messages over HTTP and injects them into a running Redpanda Connect pipeline. It's ideal for:

- Receiving webhook events from third-party services
- Accepting real-time telemetry or sensor data over HTTP
- Building lightweight ingest endpoints for client apps

For on-premises or self-managed deployments, use the xref:redpanda-connect:components:inputs/http_server.adoc[`http_server`] input instead.

This component is fully managed and available in the following Redpanda Cloud deployment types:

- **Serverless**
- **Dedicated**
- **Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC)**

When a pipeline with a `gateway` input is deployed, Redpanda Cloud provisions a secure URL that you can use to send HTTP requests. You can post raw payloads, JSON messages, or stream events in real time.

Authentication and access control are handled through standard Redpanda Cloud API tokens. For more information, see xref:redpanda-cloud:manage:api/cloud-api-authentication.adoc[].

Network access:

- On **public clusters** (Serverless and Dedicated), the gateway URL is accessible over the public internet.
- On **private clusters** (BYOC), the gateway is accessible only from within your configured VPC.

The field `rate_limit` allows you to specify an optional xref:components:rate_limits/about.adoc[`rate_limit` resource] that applies to all HTTP requests.

When the rate limit is breached, HTTP requests return a 429 response with a Retry-After header.

== Responses

You can also return a response for each message received using xref:guides:sync_responses.adoc[synchronous responses]. When doing so, you can customize headers using the `sync_response.headers` field, which supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation] in the value based on the response message contents.

== Metadata

This input adds the following metadata fields to each message:

- `http_server_user_agent`
- `http_server_request_path`
- `http_server_verb`
- `http_server_remote_ip`
- All headers (only first values are taken)
- All query parameters
- All path parameters
- All cookies

You can access these metadata fields using xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[function interpolation].

== Examples

=== Ingest a real-time stream of sensor data

Use the `gateway` input to stream telemetry data from edge devices or browser clients that connect over HTTP.

Suppose a client connects and sends JSON-encoded sensor readings like this:

[source,json]
----
{ "sensor_id": "temp-001", "value": 22.5, "unit": "C" }
{ "sensor_id": "temp-001", "value": 22.8, "unit": "C" }
{ "sensor_id": "temp-001", "value": 23.1, "unit": "C" }
----

Redpanda Connect treats each line as an individual message.

The following pipeline sets up a `gateway` input to handle these connections and logs each message:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  label: sensor_stream
  gateway:
    path: /ws/sensors
    rate_limit: ""

pipeline:
  processors:
    - log:
        level: INFO
        message: "Received reading from ${! json(\"sensor_id\") }: ${! json(\"value\") } ${! json(\"unit\") }"
----

This configuration:

* Accepts HTTP connections on `/ws/sensors`
* Receives a stream of messages over a single connection
* Logs each message using Bloblang interpolation

You can replace the `log` processor with any downstream output, such as Redpanda or Amazon S3, to persist or analyze the data in real time.
