== Examples

It's possible to increment a counter multiple times within a single mapping invocation using a map.

By specifying an optional `set` parameter it is possible to dynamically reset the counter based on input data.

The `set` parameter can also be utilized to peek at the counter without mutating it by returning `null`.
