== Examples

When the name parameter is static this function will only resolve once and yield the same result for each invocation as an optimization, this means that updates to env vars during runtime will not be reflected. You can disable this cache with the optional parameter `no_cache`, which when set to `true` will cause the variable lookup to be performed for each execution of the mapping.
