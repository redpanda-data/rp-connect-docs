=== Counting Passengers at Traffic

Given a stream of messages relating to cars passing through various traffic lights of the form:

```json
{
  "traffic_light": "cbf2eafc-806e-4067-9211-97be7e42cee3",
  "created_at": "2021-08-07T09:49:35Z",
  "registration_plate": "AB1C DEF",
  "passengers": 3
}
```

We can use a window buffer in order to create periodic messages summarizing the traffic for a period of time of this form:

```json
{
  "traffic_light": "cbf2eafc-806e-4067-9211-97be7e42cee3",
  "created_at": "2021-08-07T10:00:00Z",
  "total_cars": 15,
  "passengers": 43
}
```

With the following config:

[source,yaml]
----
buffer:
  system_window:
    timestamp_mapping: root = this.created_at
    size: 1h

pipeline:
  processors:
    # Group messages of the window into batches of common traffic light IDs
    - group_by_value:
        value: '${! json("traffic_light") }'

    # Reduce each batch to a single message by deleting indexes > 0, and
    # aggregate the car and passenger counts.
    - mapping: |
        root = if batch_index() == 0 {
          {
            "traffic_light": this.traffic_light,
            "created_at": meta("window_end_timestamp"),
            "total_cars": json("registration_plate").from_all().unique().length(),
            "passengers": json("passengers").from_all().sum(),
          }
        } else { deleted() }
