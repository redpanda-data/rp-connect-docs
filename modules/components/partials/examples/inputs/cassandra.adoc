=== Minimal Select (Cassandra/Scylla)


Let's presume that we have 3 Cassandra nodes, like in this tutorial by Sebastian Sigl from freeCodeCamp:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-apache-cassandra-beginner-tutorial/

Then if we want to select everything from the table users_by_country, we should use the configuration below.
If we specify the stdin output, the result will look like:

```json
{"age":23,"country":"UK","first_name":"Bob","last_name":"Sandler","user_email":"bob@email.com"}
```

This configuration also works for Scylla.

    query:
      'SELECT * FROM learn_cassandra.users_by_country'
