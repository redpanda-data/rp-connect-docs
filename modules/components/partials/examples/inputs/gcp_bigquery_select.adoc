=== Word counts


Here we query the public corpus of Shakespeare's works to generate a stream of the top 10 words that are 3 or more characters long:

[source,yaml]

input:
  gcp_bigquery_select:
    project: sample-project
    table: bigquery-public-data.samples.shakespeare
    columns:
      - word
      - sum(word_count) as total_count
    where: length(word) >= ?
    suffix: |
      GROUP BY word
      ORDER BY total_count DESC
      LIMIT 10
    args_mapping: |
      root = [ 3 ]
