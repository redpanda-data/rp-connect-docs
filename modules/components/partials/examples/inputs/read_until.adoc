== Examples

=== Consume N Messages

A common reason to use this input is to consume only N messages from an input and then stop. This can easily be done with the xref:guides:bloblang/functions.adoc#count[`count` function]:

[source,yaml]
----
# Only read 100 messages, and then exit.
input:
  read_until:
    check: count("messages") >= 100
    input:
      kafka:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topics: [ foo, bar ]
        consumer_group: foogroup
----

=== Read from a kafka and close when empty

A common reason to use this input is a job that consumes all messages and exits once its empty:

[source,yaml]
----
# Consumes all messages and exit when the last message was consumed 5s ago.
input:
  read_until:
    idle_timeout: 5s
    input:
      kafka:
        addresses: [ TODO ]
        topics: [ foo, bar ]
        consumer_group: foogroup
----
