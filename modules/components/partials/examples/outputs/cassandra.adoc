=== Basic Inserts

If we were to create a table with some basic columns with `CREATE TABLE foo.bar (id int primary key, content text, created_at timestamp);`, and were processing JSON documents of the form `{"id":"342354354","content":"hello world","timestamp":1605219406}` using logged batches, we could populate our table with the following config:

[source,yaml]
----
output:
  cassandra:
    addresses:
      - localhost:9042
    query: 'INSERT INTO foo.bar (id, content, created_at) VALUES (?, ?, ?)'
    args_mapping: |
      root = [
        this.id,
        this.content,
        this.timestamp
      ]
    batching:
      count: 500
      period: 1s
----

=== Insert JSON Documents

The following example inserts JSON documents into the table `footable` of the keyspace `foospace` using INSERT JSON (https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/json.html#insert-json).

[source,yaml]
----
output:
  cassandra:
    addresses:
      - localhost:9042
    query: 'INSERT INTO foospace.footable JSON ?'
    args_mapping: 'root = [ this ]'
    batching:
      count: 500
      period: 1s
