== Examples

=== Updating Documents

When updating documents, the request body should contain a combination of a `doc`, `upsert`, and/or `script` fields at the top level, this should be done via mapping processors. `doc` updates using a partial document, `script` performs an update using a scripting language such as the built in Painless language, and `upsert` updates an existing document or inserts a new one if it doesn’t exist. For more information on the structures and behaviors of these fields, please see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update.html[Elasticsearch Update API^]

[source,yaml]
----
# Partial document update
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        # Performs a partial update on the document.
        root.doc = this
  elasticsearch_v9:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: update

# Scripted update
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        # Increments the field "counter" by 1.
        root.script.source = "ctx._source.counter += 1"
  elasticsearch_v9:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: update

# Upsert
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        # If the product with the ID exists, its price will be updated to 100.
        # If the product does not exist, a new document with ID 1 and a price
        # of 50 will be inserted.
        root.doc.product_price = 50
        root.upsert.product_price = 100
  elasticsearch_v9:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: update

=== Indexing documents from Redpanda

Here we read messages from a Redpanda cluster and write them to an Elasticsearch index using a field from the message as the ID for the Elasticsearch document.

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers: [localhost:19092]
    topics: ["things"]
    consumer_group: "rpcn3"
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        root = this
output:
  elasticsearch_v9:
    urls: ['http://localhost:9200']
    index: "things"
    action: "index"
    id: ${! meta("id") }
----

=== Indexing documents from S3

Here we read messages from a AWS S3 bucket and write them to an Elasticsearch index using the S3 key as the ID for the Elasticsearch document.

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  aws_s3:
    bucket: "my-cool-bucket"
    prefix: "bug-facts/"
    scanner:
      to_the_end: {}
output:
  elasticsearch_v9:
    urls: ['http://localhost:9200']
    index: "cool-bug-facts"
    action: "index"
    id: ${! meta("s3_key") }
----

=== Create Documents

When using the `create` action, a new document will be created if the document ID does not already exist. If the document ID already exists, the operation will fail.

[source,yaml]
----
output:
  elasticsearch_v9:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! json("id") }
    action: create
----

=== Upserting Documents

When using the `upsert` action, if the document ID already exists, it will be updated. If the document ID does not exist, a new document will be inserted. The request body should contain the document to be indexed.

[source,yaml]
----
output:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        meta id = this.id
        root = this.doc
  elasticsearch_v9:
    urls: [localhost:9200]
    index: foo
    id: ${! @id }
    action: upsert
