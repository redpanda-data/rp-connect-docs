=== Simple Common Output

Data is generated and written to a topic bar, targeting the cluster configured within the `redpanda` block at the bottom. This is useful as it allows us to configure TLS and SASL only once for potentially multiple inputs and outputs.

pipeline:

        root.id = uuid_v4()
