=== Exactly once CDC into Snowflake

How to send data from a PostgreSQL table into Snowflake exactly once using Postgres Logical Replication.

NOTE: If attempting to do exactly-once it's important that rows are delivered in order to the output. Be sure to read the documentation for offset_token first.
Removing the offset_token is a safer option that will instruct Redpanda Connect to use its default at-least-once delivery model instead.

input:
  postgres_cdc:
    dsn: postgres://foouser:foopass@localhost:5432/foodb
    schema: "public"
    slot_name: "my_repl_slot"
    tables: ["my_pg_table"]
    # We want very large batches - each batch will be sent to Snowflake individually
    # so to optimize query performance we want as big of files as we have memory for
    batching:
      count: 50000
      period: 45s
    # Prevent multiple batches from being in flight at once, so that we never send
    # a batch while another batch is being retried, this is important to ensure that
    # the Snowflake Snowpipe Streaming channel does not see older data - as it will
    # assume that the older data is already committed.
    checkpoint_limit: 1
output:
  snowflake_streaming:
    # We use the log sequence number in the WAL from Postgres to ensure we
    # only upload data exactly once, these are already lexicographically
    # ordered.
    offset_token: "${!@lsn}"
    # Since we're sending a single ordered log, we can only send one thing
    # at a time to ensure that we're properly incrementing our offset_token
    # and only using a single channel at a time.

=== Ingesting data exactly once from Redpanda

How to ingest data from Redpanda with consumer groups, decode the schema using the schema registry, then write the corresponding data into Snowflake exactly once.

NOTE: If attempting to do exactly-once its important that records are delivered in order to the output and correctly partitioned. Be sure to read the documentation for
channel_name and offset_token first. Removing the offset_token is a safer option that will instruct Redpanda Connect to use its default at-least-once delivery model instead.

    # We want very large batches - each batch will be sent to Snowflake individually
    # so to optimize query performance we want as big of files as we have memory for

        # leading zeros

    # In order to prevent delivery orders from messing with the order of delivered records
    # it's important that failures are immediately sent to a dead letter queue and not retried
    # to Snowflake. See the ordering documentation for the "redpanda" input for more details.

=== HTTP Server to push data to Snowflake

This example demonstrates how to create an HTTP server input that can recieve HTTP PUT requests
with JSON payloads, that are buffered locally then written to Snowflake in batches.

NOTE: This example uses a buffer to respond to the HTTP request immediately, so it's possible that failures to deliver data could result in data loss.
See the documentation about xref:components:buffers/memory.adoc[buffers] for more information, or remove the buffer entirely to respond to the HTTP request only once the data is written to Snowflake.

[source,yaml]

  http_server:
    path: /snowflake
buffer:
  memory:
    # Max inflight data before applying backpressure
    limit: 524288000 # 50MiB
    # Batching policy, influences how large the generated files sent to Snowflake are
    batch_policy:
      enabled: true
      byte_size: 33554432 # 32MiB

    schema: "PUBLIC"
    table: "MYTABLE"
    private_key_file: "my/private/key.p8"
    # By default there is only a single channel per output table allowed
    # if we want to have multiple Redpanda Connect streams writing data
    # then we need a unique channel prefix per stream. We'll use the host
    # name to get unique prefixes in this example.
