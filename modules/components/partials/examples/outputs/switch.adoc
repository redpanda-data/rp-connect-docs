== Examples

=== Basic Multiplexing


The most common use for a switch output is to multiplex messages across a range of output destinations. The following config checks the contents of the field `type` of messages and sends `foo` type messages to an `amqp_1` output, `bar` type messages to a `gcp_pubsub` output, and everything else to a `redis_streams` output.

Outputs can have their own processors associated with them, and in this example the `redis_streams` output has a processor that enforces the presence of a type field before sending it.

[source,yaml]
----
output:
  switch:
    cases:
      - check: this.type == "foo"
        output:
          amqp_1:
            urls: [ amqps://guest:guest@localhost:5672/ ]
            target_address: queue:/the_foos

      - check: this.type == "bar"
        output:
          gcp_pubsub:
            project: dealing_with_mike
            topic: mikes_bars

      - output:
          redis_streams:
            url: tcp://localhost:6379
            stream: everything_else
          processors:
            - mapping: |
                root = this
                root.type = this.type | "unknown"

=== Control Flow


The `continue` field allows messages that have passed a case to be tested against the next one also. This can be useful when combining non-mutually-exclusive case checks.

In the following example a message that passes both the check of the first case as well as the second will be routed to both.

[source,yaml]
----
output:
  switch:
    cases:
      - check: 'this.user.interests.contains("walks").catch(false)'
        output:
          amqp_1:
            urls: [ amqps://guest:guest@localhost:5672/ ]
            target_address: queue:/people_what_think_good
        continue: true

      - check: 'this.user.dislikes.contains("videogames").catch(false)'
        output:
          gcp_pubsub:
            project: people
            topic: that_i_dont_want_to_hang_with
