== Examples

=== Tar Archive


If we had JSON messages in a batch each of the form:

```json
{"doc":{"id":"foo","body":"hello world 1"}}
```

And we wished to tar archive them, setting their filenames to their respective unique IDs (with the extension `.json`), our config might look like
this:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - archive:
        format: tar
        path: ${!json("doc.id")}.json
----
