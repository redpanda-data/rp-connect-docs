== Examples

=== Cron Scheduled Command

This example uses a xref:components:inputs/generate.adoc[`generate` input] to trigger a command on a cron schedule:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  generate:
    interval: '0,30 */2 * * * *'
    mapping: 'root = ""' # Empty string as we do not need to pipe anything to stdin
  processors:
    - command:
        name: df
        args_mapping: '[ "-h" ]'
----

=== Dynamic Command Execution

This example config takes structured messages of the form `{"command":"echo","args":["foo"]}` and uses their contents to execute the contained command and arguments dynamically, replacing its contents with the command result printed to stdout:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - command:
        name: ${! this.command }
        args_mapping: 'this.args'
----
