=== Grouped Processing

Imagine we have a batch of messages that we wish to split into a group of foos and everything else, which should be sent to different output destinations based on those groupings. We also need to send the foos as a tar gzip archive. For this purpose we can use the `group_by` processor with a xref:components:outputs/switch.adoc[`switch`] output:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - group_by:
      - check: content().contains("this is a foo")
        processors:
          - archive:
              format: tar
          - compress:
              algorithm: gzip
          - mapping: 'meta grouping = "foo"'

output:
  switch:
    cases:
      - check: meta("grouping") == "foo"
        output:
          gcp_pubsub:
            project: foo_prod
            topic: only_the_foos
      - output:
          gcp_pubsub:
            project: somewhere_else
            topic: no_foos_here
