=== Branched Request

This example uses a xref:components:processors/branch.adoc[`branch` processor] to strip the request message into an empty body, grab an HTTP payload, and place the result back into the original message at the path `repo.status`:

[source,yaml]

pipeline:
  processors:
    - branch:
        request_map: 'root = ""'
        processors:
          - http:
              url: https://hub.docker.com/v2/repositories/jeffail/benthos
              verb: GET
              headers:
                Content-Type: application/json
        result_map: 'root.repo.status = this'
