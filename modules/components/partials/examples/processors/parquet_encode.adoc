=== Writing Parquet Files to AWS S3

In this example we use the batching mechanism of an `aws_s3` output to collect a batch of messages in memory, which then converts it to a parquet file and uploads it.

output:
  aws_s3:
    bucket: TODO
    path: 'stuff/${! timestamp_unix() }-${! uuid_v4() }.parquet'
    batching:
      count: 1000
      period: 10s
      processors:
        - parquet_encode:
            schema:
              - name: id
                type: INT64
              - name: weight
                type: DOUBLE
              - name: content
                type: BYTE_ARRAY
            default_compression: zstd
