=== Grouped Processing

Imagine we have a collection of processors who cover a specific functionality. We could use this processor to group them together and make it easier to read and mock during testing by giving the whole block a label:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - label: my_super_feature
      processors:
        - log:
            message: "Let's do something cool"
        - archive:
            format: json_array
        - mapping: root.items = this
----
