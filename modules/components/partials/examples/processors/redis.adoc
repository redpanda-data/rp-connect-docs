== Examples

=== Querying Cardinality

If given payloads containing a metadata field `set_key` it's possible to query and store the cardinality of the set for each message using a xref:components:processors/branch.adoc[`branch` processor] in order to augment rather than replace the message contents:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - branch:
        processors:
          - redis:
              url: TODO
              command: scard
              args_mapping: 'root = [ meta("set_key") ]'
        result_map: 'root.cardinality = this'
----

=== Running Total

If we have JSON data containing number of friends visited during covid 19:

```json
{"name":"ash","month":"feb","year":2019,"friends_visited":10}
{"name":"ash","month":"apr","year":2019,"friends_visited":-2}
{"name":"bob","month":"feb","year":2019,"friends_visited":3}
{"name":"bob","month":"apr","year":2019,"friends_visited":1}
```

We can add a field that contains the running total number of friends visited:

```json
{"name":"ash","month":"feb","year":2019,"friends_visited":10,"total":10}
{"name":"ash","month":"apr","year":2019,"friends_visited":-2,"total":8}
{"name":"bob","month":"feb","year":2019,"friends_visited":3,"total":3}
{"name":"bob","month":"apr","year":2019,"friends_visited":1,"total":4}
```

Using the `incrby` command:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - branch:
        processors:
          - redis:
              url: TODO
              command: incrby
              args_mapping: 'root = [ this.name, this.friends_visited ]'
        result_map: 'root.total = this'
