=== Stop ignoring me Taz


Here we have a config where I generate animal noises and send them to Taz via HTTP. Taz has a tendency to stop his servers whenever I dispatch my animals upon him, and therefore these HTTP requests sometimes fail. However, I have the retry processor and with this super power I can specify a back off policy and it will ensure that for each animal noise the HTTP processor is attempted until either it succeeds or my Redpanda Connect instance is stopped.

I even go as far as to zero-out the maximum elapsed time field, which means that for each animal noise I will wait indefinitely, because I really really want Taz to receive every single animal noise that he is entitled to.
