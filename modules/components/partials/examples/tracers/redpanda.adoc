== Examples

=== Basic tracing setup

Enable tracing for a pipeline, sending all trace data to a local Redpanda cluster.

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  redpanda:
    addresses: [ "localhost:9092" ]
    topics: [ "orders" ]

pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = this
        root.processed_at = now()

output:
  redpanda:
    addresses: [ "localhost:9092" ]
    topic: "processed_orders"

tracer:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers: [ "localhost:9092" ]
    topic: otel-traces
    service: order-processor
----

=== Production tracing with sampling

Configure tracing for a production environment with sampling to reduce trace volume and secure authentication.

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  redpanda:
    addresses: [ "redpanda-prod:9092" ]
    topics: [ "events" ]

pipeline:
  processors:
    - branch:
        request_map: 'root = this'
        processors:
          - mapping: 'root.enriched = true'

output:
  redpanda:
    addresses: [ "redpanda-prod:9092" ]
    topic: "processed_events"

tracer:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers: [ "redpanda-prod:9092" ]
    topic: otel-traces
    service: event-processor-prod
    sampling:
      enabled: true
      ratio: "0.1"  # Sample 10% of traces
    tls:
      enabled: true
    sasl:
      mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
      username: tracer-user
      password: ${TRACER_PASSWORD}
----

=== Multi-instance tracing

Configure tracing for multiple Redpanda Connect instances with unique service names for correlation.

[source,yaml]
----
# Instance 1: Ingestion service
tracer:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers: [ "redpanda:9092" ]
    topic: otel-traces
    service: ingestion-service
    tags:
      environment: production
      region: us-west-2
      instance: ingestion-01

# Instance 2: Processing service
tracer:
  redpanda:
    seed_brokers: [ "redpanda:9092" ]
    topic: otel-traces
    service: processing-service
    tags:
      environment: production
      region: us-west-2
      instance: processing-01
