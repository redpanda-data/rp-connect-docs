== Fields

=== `allowed_lateness`

An optional duration string describing the length of time to wait after a window has ended before flushing it, allowing late arrivals to be included. Since this windowing buffer uses the system clock an allowed lateness can improve the matching of messages when using event time.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
allowed_lateness: 10s
allowed_lateness: 1m
----

=== `offset`

An optional duration string to offset the beginning of each window by, otherwise they are aligned to the zeroth minute and zeroth hour on the UTC clock. The offset cannot be a larger or equal measure to the window size or the slide.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
offset: -6h
offset: 30m
----

=== `size`

A duration string describing the size of each window. By default windows are aligned to the zeroth minute and zeroth hour on the UTC clock, meaning windows of 1 hour duration will match the turn of each hour in the day, this can be adjusted with the `offset` field.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
size: 30s
size: 10m
----

=== `slide`

An optional duration string describing by how much time the beginning of each window should be offset from the beginning of the previous, and therefore creates sliding windows instead of tumbling. When specified this duration must be smaller than the `size` of the window.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
slide: 30s
slide: 10m
----

=== `timestamp_mapping`


A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] applied to each message during ingestion that provides the timestamp to use for allocating it a window. By default the function `now()` is used in order to generate a fresh timestamp at the time of ingestion (the processing time), whereas this mapping can instead extract a timestamp from the message itself (the event time).

The timestamp value assigned to `root` must either be a numerical unix time in seconds (with up to nanosecond precision via decimals), or a string in ISO 8601 format. If the mapping fails or provides an invalid result the message will be dropped (with logging to describe the problem).


*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `root = now()`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
timestamp_mapping: root = this.created_at
timestamp_mapping: root = meta("kafka_timestamp_unix").number()
----
