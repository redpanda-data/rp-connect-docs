== Fields

=== `algorithm`

the lru cache implementation

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `standard`

[cols="1m,2a"]
|===
|Option |Summary

|arc
|is an adaptive replacement cache. It tracks recent evictions as well as recent usage in both the frequent and recent caches. Its computational overhead is comparable to two_queues, but the memory overhead is linear with the size of the cache. ARC has been patented by IBM.

|standard
|is a simple LRU cache. It is based on the LRU implementation in groupcache

|two_queues
|tracks frequently used and recently used entries separately. This avoids a burst of accesses from taking out frequently used entries, at the cost of about 2x computational overhead and some extra bookkeeping.

|===

=== `cap`

The cache maximum capacity (number of entries)

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1000`

=== `init_values`

A table of key/value pairs that should be present in the cache on initialization. This can be used to create static lookup tables.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `{}`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
init_values:
  Nickelback: "1995"
  Spice Girls: "1994"
  The Human League: "1977"

----

=== `optimistic`

If true, we do not lock on read/write events. The lru package is thread-safe, however the ADD operation is not atomic.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `two_queues_ghost_ratio`

is the default ratio of ghost entries kept to track entries recently evicted on two_queues cache.

*Type*: `float`

*Default*: `0.5`

=== `two_queues_recent_ratio`

is the ratio of the two_queues cache dedicated to recently added entries that have only been accessed once.

*Type*: `float`

*Default*: `0.25`
