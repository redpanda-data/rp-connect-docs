== Fields

=== `allow_auto_topic_creation`

Enables topics to be auto created if they do not exist when fetching their metadata.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `conn_idle_timeout`

The amount of time that connections can remain idle before they are closed.

*Type*: `string`

=== `tcp`

Configure TCP socket-level settings to optimize network performance and reliability. These low-level controls are useful for:

- **High-latency networks**: Increase `connect_timeout` to allow more time for connection establishment
- **Long-lived connections**: Configure `keep_alive` settings to detect and recover from stale connections
- **Unstable networks**: Tune keep-alive probes to balance between quick failure detection and avoiding false positives
- **Linux systems with specific requirements**: Use `tcp_user_timeout` (Linux 2.6.37+) to control data acknowledgment timeouts

Most users should keep the default values. Only modify these settings if you're experiencing connection stability issues or have specific network requirements.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tcp.connect_timeout`

Maximum amount of time a dial will wait for a connect to complete. Zero disables.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `0s`

=== `tcp.keep_alive`

TCP keep-alive probe configuration.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.count`

Maximum unanswered keep-alive probes before dropping the connection. Zero defaults to 9.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `9`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.idle`

Duration the connection must be idle before sending the first keep-alive probe. Zero defaults to 15s. Negative values disable keep-alive probes.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `15s`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.interval`

Duration between keep-alive probes. Zero defaults to 15s.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `15s`

=== `tcp.tcp_user_timeout`

Maximum time to wait for acknowledgment of transmitted data before killing the connection. Linux-only (kernel 2.6.37+), ignored on other platforms. When enabled, keep_alive.idle must be greater than this value per RFC 5482. Zero disables.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `0s`

=== `tls`

Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings to secure network connections. This includes options for standard TLS as well as mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both client and server authenticate each other using certificates. Key configuration options include `enabled` to enable TLS, `client_certs` for mTLS authentication, `root_cas`/`root_cas_file` for custom certificate authorities, and `skip_cert_verify` for development environments.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. Configure this field to enable mTLS, authenticating the client to the server with these certificates.

You must set `tls.enabled: true` for the client certificates to take effect.

**Certificate pairing rules**: For each certificate item, provide either:

- Inline PEM data using both `cert` *and* `key` or
- File paths using both `cert_file` *and* `key_file`.

Mixing inline and file-based values within the same item is not supported.

*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `[]`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar


# ---

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key

----

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

The plaintext certificate to use for TLS authentication. Must be paired with the corresponding private key in the `key` field when using inline PEM data for mTLS client certificates.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path to a file containing the certificate to use for TLS authentication. Must be paired with the corresponding private key file in the `key_file` field when using file-based configuration for mTLS client certificates.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

Private key for mTLS client certificate as inline PEM data. Must correspond to the client certificate specified in the `cert` field. Use this field together with `cert` when providing certificate data inline rather than through files.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

Path to private key file for mTLS client certificate in PEM format. Must correspond to the client certificate specified in the `cert_file` field. Use this field together with `cert_file` when loading certificate data from files.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

The password to use for the private key (specified in the `key` or `key_file` fields), if it is password-protected. The PKCS#1 and PKCS#8 formats are supported. Supports environment variable interpolation for secure password management.

The `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is obsolete and not supported for the PKCS#8 format. This algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, making it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
password: foo

# ---

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
----

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: 
tls: no renegotiation`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

Specify the path to a root certificate authority file (optional). This is a file, often with a `.pem` extension, which contains a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. Use either this field for file-based certificate loading or `root_cas` for inline certificate data.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification. Set to `true` only for testing environments as this reduces security by disabling certificate validation. When using self-signed certificates or in development, this may be necessary, but should never be used in production. Consider using `root_cas` or `root_cas_file` to specify trusted certificates instead of disabling verification entirely.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `topic`

The topic to store data in.

*Type*: `string`
