== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m

----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"

----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s
period: 1m
period: 500ms

----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines

  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum gap between the in flight sequence versus the latest acknowledged sequence at a given time. Increasing this limit enables parallel processing and batching at the output level to work on individual shards. Any given sequence will not be committed unless all messages under that offset are delivered in order to preserve at least once delivery guarantees.

*Default*: `5s`

The secret for the AWS credentials in use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `object`

=== `dynamodb.billing_mode`

When creating the table determines the billing mode.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `PAY_PER_REQUEST`

*Options*: `PROVISIONED`, `PAY_PER_REQUEST`

=== `dynamodb.create`

Whether, if the table does not exist, it should be created.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `dynamodb.credentials`

Manually configure the AWS credentials to use (optional). For more information, see the xref:guides:cloud/aws.adoc[].

*Type*: `object`

=== `dynamodb.credentials.from_ec2_role`

Use the credentials of a host EC2 machine configured to assume https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html[an IAM role associated with the instance^].

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.2.0 or later.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

=== `dynamodb.endpoint`

Specify a custom endpoint for the AWS API.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `steal_grace_period`

Determines how long beyond the next commit period a client will wait when stealing a shard for the current owner to store a checkpoint. A longer value increases the time taken to balance shards but reduces the likelihood of processing duplicate messages.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `2s`

=== `streams[]`

One or more Kinesis data streams to consume from. Streams can either be specified by their name or full ARN. Shards of a stream are automatically balanced across consumers by coordinating through the provided DynamoDB table. Multiple comma separated streams can be listed in a single element. Shards are automatically distributed across consumers of a stream by coordinating through the provided DynamoDB table. Alternatively, it's possible to specify an explicit shard to consume from with a colon after the stream name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the shard `0` of the stream `foo`.

*Type*: `string`
