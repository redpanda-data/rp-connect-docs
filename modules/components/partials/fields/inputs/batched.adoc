== Fields

=== `child`

The child input.

*Type*: `input`

=== `policy`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
policy:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
policy:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
policy:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m

----

=== `policy.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `policy.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"

----

=== `policy.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `policy.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s
period: 1m
period: 500ms

----

=== `policy.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines
