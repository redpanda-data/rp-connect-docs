== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batch_count`

Optionally process records in batches. This can help to speed up the consumption of exceptionally large CSV files. When the end of the file is reached the remaining records are processed as a (potentially smaller) batch.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1`

=== `delete_on_finish`

Whether to delete input files from the disk once they are fully consumed.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `delimiter`

The delimiter to use for splitting values in each record. It must be a single character.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `,`

=== `lazy_quotes`

If set to `true`, a quote may appear in an unquoted field and a non-doubled quote may appear in a quoted field.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.1.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `parse_header_row`

Whether to reference the first row as a header row. If set to true the output structure for messages will be an object where field keys are determined by the header row. Otherwise, each message will consist of an array of values from the corresponding CSV row.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `paths[]`

A list of file paths to read from. Each file will be read sequentially until the list is exhausted, at which point the input will close. Glob patterns are supported, including super globs (double star).

*Type*: `array`
