== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batch_size`

The number of generated messages that should be accumulated into each batch flushed at the specified interval.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1`

=== `count`

An optional number of messages to generate, if set above 0 the specified number of messages is generated and then the input will shut down.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `interval`

The time interval at which messages should be generated, expressed either as a duration string or as a cron expression. If set to an empty string messages will be generated as fast as downstream services can process them. Cron expressions can specify a timezone by prefixing the expression with `TZ=<location name>`, where the location name corresponds to a file within the IANA Time Zone database.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1s`

=== `mapping`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang] mapping to use for generating messages.
