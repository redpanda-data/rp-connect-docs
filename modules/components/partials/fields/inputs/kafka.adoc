== Fields

=== `addresses[]`

A list of broker addresses to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
addresses:
  - "localhost:9092"

# ---

addresses:
  - "localhost:9041,localhost:9042"

# ---

addresses:
  - "localhost:9041"
  - "localhost:9042"
----

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages of the same topic and partition that can be processed at a given time. Increasing this limit enables parallel processing and batching at the output level to work on individual partitions.

Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `string`

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `target_version`

# ---

target_version: 3.1.0
----

=== `timely_nacks_maximum_wait`

EXPERIMENTAL: Specify a maximum period of time in which each message can be consumed and awaiting either acknowledgement or rejection before rejection is instead forced. This can be useful for avoiding situations where certain downstream components can result in blocked confirmation of delivery that exceeds SLAs. Accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

*Type*: `object`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

Alternatively, it's possible to specify explicit partitions to consume from with a colon after the topic name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges, e.g. `foo:0-10` would consume partitions 0 through to 10 inclusive.
