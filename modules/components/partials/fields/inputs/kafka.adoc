== Fields

=== `addresses[]`

A list of broker addresses to connect to. If an item of the list contains commas it will be expanded into multiple addresses.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
addresses:
  - "localhost:9092"

  - "localhost:9041,localhost:9042"

  - "localhost:9041"
  - "localhost:9042"

----

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s

----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----

processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines

----

=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages of the same topic and partition that can be processed at a given time. Increasing this limit enables parallel processing and batching at the output level to work on individual partitions.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `extract_tracing_map`

EXPERIMENTAL: A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] that attempts to extract an object containing tracing propagation information, which will then be used as the root tracing span for the message.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----

[cols="1m,2a"]
|===

|PLAIN
|Plain text authentication. NOTE: When using plain text auth it is extremely likely that you'll also need to <<tls-enabled, enable TLS>>.

The version of the Kafka protocol to use. This limits the capabilities used by the client and should ideally match the version of your brokers. Defaults to the oldest supported stable version.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
target_version: 2.1.0
target_version: 3.1.0
----

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----

Alternatively, it's possible to specify explicit partitions to consume from with a colon after the topic name, e.g. `foo:0` would consume the partition 0 of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges, e.g. `foo:0-10` would consume partitions 0 through to 10 inclusive.
