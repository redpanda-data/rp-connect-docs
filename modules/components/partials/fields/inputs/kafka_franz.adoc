== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay rejected messages (negative acknowledgements) at the output level. If the cause of rejections persists, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batching`

Configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy] that applies to individual topic partitions in order to batch messages together before flushing them for processing. Batching can be beneficial for performance as well as useful for windowed processing, and doing so this way preserves the ordering of topic partitions.

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

The number of bytes at which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable size-based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

The number of messages after which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable count-based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

The period of time after which an incomplete batch is flushed regardless of its size. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s

# ---

period: 1m

# ---

period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. All resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, and therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages that are processed in parallel inside the same partition before back pressure is applied. 

When a message with a specific offset is delivered to the output, the offset is only committed when all messages of previous offsets have also been delivered. This behavior ensures at-least-once delivery guarantees. However, in the event of crashes or server faults, it also increases the likelihood of duplicates. To decrease this risk, reduce the `checkpoint_limit` value.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1024`

=== `client_id`

An identifier for the client connection.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `redpanda-connect`

=== `commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `conn_idle_timeout`

The maximum duration that connections can remain idle before they are automatically closed. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `20s`

=== `consumer_group`

An optional consumer group. When you specify this value: 

- The partitions of any topics, specified in the `topics` field, are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group
- Partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name

Consumer groups are not supported when you specify explicit partitions to consume from in the `topics` field.

*Type*: `string`

=== `fetch_max_bytes`

The maximum size of a message batch (in bytes) that a broker tries to send during a client fetch. If individual records exceed the `fetch_max_bytes` value, brokers will still send them.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `50MiB`

=== `fetch_max_partition_bytes`

The maximum number of bytes that are consumed from a single partition in a fetch request. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.max.partition.bytes`.

If a single batch is larger than the `fetch_max_partition_bytes` value, the batch is still sent so that the client can make progress.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1MiB`

=== `fetch_max_wait`

The maximum period of time a broker can wait for a fetch response to reach the required minimum number of bytes (`fetch_min_bytes`).

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `fetch_min_bytes`

The minimum number of bytes that a broker tries to send during a fetch. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.min.bytes`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1B`

=== `heartbeat_interval`

When you specify a `consumer_group`, `heartbeat_interval` sets how frequently a consumer group member should send heartbeats to Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka uses heartbeats to make sure that a group member's session is active. 

You must set `heartbeat_interval` to less than one-third of `session_timeout`.

This field is equivalent to the Java `heartbeat.interval.ms` setting and accepts Go duration format strings such as `10s` or `2m`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `3s`

=== `instance_id`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, assign a unique value to `instance_id` to define the group’s static membership, which can prevent unnecessary rebalances during reconnections. 

When you assign an instance ID, the client does not automatically leave the consumer group when it disconnects. To remove the client, you must use an external admin command on behalf of the instance ID.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `metadata_max_age`

The maximum period of time after which metadata is refreshed. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

Lower values provide more responsive topic and partition discovery but may increase broker load. Higher values reduce broker queries but can delay detection of topology changes.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1m`

=== `multi_header`

Decode headers into lists to allow the handling of multiple values with the same key.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `rack_id`

A rack specifies where the client is physically located, and changes fetch requests to consume from the closest replica as opposed to the leader replica.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `rebalance_timeout`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `rebalance_timeout` sets a time limit for all consumer group members to complete their work and commit offsets after a rebalance has begun. The timeout excludes the time taken to detect a failed or late heartbeat, which indicates a rebalance is required. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `45s`

=== `regexp_topics_exclude[]`

A list of regular expression patterns for excluding topics when regex mode is enabled (via `regexp_topics` or `regexp_topics_include`). Topics matching any of these patterns will be excluded from consumption, even if they match include patterns.

Each pattern is a full regular expression evaluated against the complete topic name. Patterns are not anchored by default, so use `^` and `$` for exact matching. Exclude patterns are applied after include patterns, providing fine-grained control over topic selection.

Example: `regexp_topics_exclude: ["^_", ".*-temp$", ".*-test.*"]` excludes topics starting with underscore, ending with `-temp`, or containing `-test`.

*Type*: `array`

=== `regexp_topics_include[]`

A list of regular expression patterns for matching topics to consume from. When specified, the client will periodically refresh the list of matching topics based on the `metadata_max_age` interval.

Each pattern is a full regular expression evaluated against the complete topic name. Patterns are not anchored by default, so `logs_.*` matches `my-logs_events` and `logs_errors`. Use `^logs_.*$` to match only topics starting with `logs_`.

This field enables regex mode and cannot be used together with explicit `topics` lists. Use `regexp_topics_exclude` to filter out specific patterns from the matched topics.

Example: `regexp_topics_include: ["events_.*", "logs_.*"]` consumes from all topics starting with `events_` or `logs_`.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
regexp_topics_include:
  - logs_.*
  - metrics_.*

# ---

regexp_topics_include:
  - "events_[0-9]+"
----

=== `request_timeout_overhead`

Grants an additional buffer or overhead to requests that have timeout fields defined. This field is based on the behavior of Apache Kafka's `request.timeout.ms` parameter.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `10s`

=== `sasl[]`

Specify one or more methods or mechanisms of SASL authentication, which are attempted in order. If the broker supports the first SASL mechanism, all connections use it. If the first mechanism fails, the client picks the first supported mechanism. If the broker does not support any client mechanisms, all connections fail.

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
sasl:
  - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-512
    password: bar
    username: foo

----

=== `sasl[].aws`

# ---

seed_brokers:
  - "foo:9092,bar:9092"
----

=== `session_timeout`

When you specify a `consumer_group`, `session_timeout` sets the maximum interval between heartbeats sent by a consumer group member to the broker. If a broker doesn't receive a heartbeat from a group member before the timeout expires, it removes the member from the consumer group and initiates a rebalance. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

|===

=== `tcp`

Configure TCP socket-level settings to optimize network performance and reliability. These low-level controls are useful for:

- **High-latency networks**: Increase `connect_timeout` to allow more time for connection establishment
- **Long-lived connections**: Configure `keep_alive` settings to detect and recover from stale connections
- **Unstable networks**: Tune keep-alive probes to balance between quick failure detection and avoiding false positives
- **Linux systems with specific requirements**: Use `tcp_user_timeout` (Linux 2.6.37+) to control data acknowledgment timeouts

Most users should keep the default values. Only modify these settings if you're experiencing connection stability issues or have specific network requirements.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tcp.connect_timeout`

Maximum amount of time a dial will wait for a connect to complete. Zero disables.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `0s`

=== `tcp.keep_alive`

TCP keep-alive probe configuration.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.count`

Maximum unanswered keep-alive probes before dropping the connection. Zero defaults to 9.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `9`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.idle`

Duration the connection must be idle before sending the first keep-alive probe. Zero defaults to 15s. Negative values disable keep-alive probes.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `15s`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.interval`

Duration between keep-alive probes. Zero defaults to 15s.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `15s`

=== `tcp.tcp_user_timeout`

Maximum time to wait for acknowledgment of transmitted data before killing the connection. Linux-only (kernel 2.6.37+), ignored on other platforms. When enabled, keep_alive.idle must be greater than this value per RFC 5482. Zero disables.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `0s`

=== `timely_nacks_maximum_wait`

EXPERIMENTAL: Specify a maximum period of time in which each message can be consumed and awaiting either acknowledgement or rejection before rejection is instead forced. This can be useful for avoiding situations where certain downstream components can result in blocked confirmation of delivery that exceeds SLAs. Accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

=== `tls`

Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings to secure network connections. This includes options for standard TLS as well as mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both client and server authenticate each other using certificates. Key configuration options include `enabled` to enable TLS, `client_certs` for mTLS authentication, `root_cas`/`root_cas_file` for custom certificate authorities, and `skip_cert_verify` for development environments.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. Configure this field to enable mTLS, authenticating the client to the server with these certificates.

You must set `tls.enabled: true` for the client certificates to take effect.

**Certificate pairing rules**: For each certificate item, provide either:

- Inline PEM data using both `cert` *and* `key` or
- File paths using both `cert_file` *and* `key_file`.

Mixing inline and file-based values within the same item is not supported.

*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `[]`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key

----

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.


include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
password: foo

# ---

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
----

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.root_cas`

Specify a root certificate authority to use (optional). This is a string that represents a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. Use either this field for inline certificate data or `root_cas_file` for file-based certificate loading.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

Specify the path to a root certificate authority file (optional). This is a file, often with a `.pem` extension, which contains a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. Use either this field for file-based certificate loading or `root_cas` for inline certificate data.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification. Set to `true` only for testing environments as this reduces security by disabling certificate validation. When using self-signed certificates or in development, this may be necessary, but should never be used in production. Consider using `root_cas` or `root_cas_file` to specify trusted certificates instead of disabling verification entirely.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `topic_lag_refresh_period`

The interval between refresh cycles. During each cycle, this input queries the Redpanda Connect server to calculate the topic lag minus the number of produced messages that remain to be read from each topic/partition pair by the specified consumer group. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `topics[]`

A list of topics to consume from. Use commas to separate multiple topics in a single element.

When a `consumer_group` is specified, partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Otherwise, all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, you can specify explicit partitions to consume by using a colon after the topic name. For example, `foo:0` would consume the partition `0` of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges. For example, `foo:0-10` would consume partitions `0` through to `10` inclusive.

It is also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition. For example, `foo:0:10` would consume the partition `0` of the topic `foo` starting from the offset `10`. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_offset` determines which offset to start from.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
topics:
  - foo
  - bar

# ---

topics:
  - things.*

# ---

topics:
  - "foo,bar"

=== `transaction_isolation_level`

The isolation level for handling transactional messages. This setting determines how transactions are processed and affects data consistency guarantees.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `read_uncommitted`

[cols="1m,2a"]
