== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s
period: 1m
period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines

  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `checkpoint_cache`

A https://www.docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-connect/components/caches/about[cache resource^] to use for storing the current latest Log Sequence Number (LSN) that has been successfully delivered, this allows Redpanda Connect to continue from that Log Sequence Number (LSN) upon restart, rather than consume the entire state of the change table.

*Type*: `string`

=== `checkpoint_key`

The key to use to store the snapshot position in `checkpoint_cache`. An alternative key can be provided if multiple CDC inputs share the same cache.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `microsoft_sql_server_cdc`

=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages that can be processed at a given time. Increasing this limit enables parallel processing and batching at the output level. Any given Log Sequence Number (LSN) will not be acknowledged unless all messages under that offset are delivered in order to preserve at least once delivery guarantees.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1024`

=== `connection_string`

The connection string of the Microsoft SQL Server database to connect to.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
connection_string: sqlserver://username:password@host/instance?param1=value&param2=value
----

=== `exclude[]`

Regular expressions for tables to exclude.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
exclude:
  - dbo.privatetable

----

=== `include[]`

Regular expressions for tables to include.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
include:
  - dbo.products

----

=== `snapshot_max_batch_size`

The maximum number of rows to be streamed in a single batch when taking a snapshot.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1000`

=== `stream_backoff_interval`

The interval between attempts to check for new changes once all data is processed. For low traffic tables increasing this value can reduce network traffic to the server.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
stream_backoff_interval: 5s
stream_backoff_interval: 1m
----

=== `stream_snapshot`

If set to true, the connector will query all the existing data as a part of snapshot process. Otherwise, it will start from the current Log Sequence Number position.

*Type*: `bool`
