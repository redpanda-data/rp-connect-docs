== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batch_count`

Optionally process records in batches. This can help to speed up the consumption of exceptionally large files. When the end of the file is reached the remaining records are processed as a (potentially smaller) batch.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1`

=== `paths[]`

A list of file paths to read from. Each file will be read sequentially until the list is exhausted, at which point the input will close. Glob patterns are supported, including super globs (double star).

*Type*: `array`
