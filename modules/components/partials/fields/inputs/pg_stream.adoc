== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s

# ---

period: 1m

# ---

period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `checkpoint_limit`

The maximum number of messages that can be processed at a given time. Increasing this limit enables parallel processing and batching at the output level. Any given LSN will not be acknowledged unless all messages under that offset are delivered in order to preserve at least once delivery guarantees.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1024`

=== `dsn`

The Data Source Name for the PostgreSQL database in the form of `postgres://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname][?param1=value1&...]`. Please note that Postgres enforces SSL by default, you can override this with the parameter `sslmode=disable` if required.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
dsn: postgres://foouser:foopass@localhost:5432/foodb?sslmode=disable
----

=== `heartbeat_interval`

The interval at which to write heartbeat messages. Heartbeat messages are needed in scenarios when the subscribed tables are low frequency, but there are other high frequency tables writing. Due to the checkpointing mechanism for replication slots, not having new messages to acknowledge will prevent postgres from reclaiming the write ahead log, which can exhaust the local disk. Having heartbeats allows Redpanda Connect to safely acknowledge data periodically and move forward the committed point in the log so it can be reclaimed. Setting the duration to 0s will disable heartbeats entirely. Heartbeats are created by periodically writing logical messages to the write ahead log using `pg_logical_emit_message`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1h`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
heartbeat_interval: 0s

# ---

heartbeat_interval: 24h
----

=== `include_transaction_markers`

When set to true, empty messages with operation types BEGIN and COMMIT are generated for the beginning and end of each transaction. Messages with operation metadata set to "begin" or "commit" will have null message payloads.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `max_parallel_snapshot_tables`

Int specifies a number of tables that will be processed in parallel during the snapshot processing stage

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1`

=== `pg_standby_timeout`

Specify the standby timeout before refreshing an idle connection.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `10s`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
pg_standby_timeout: 30s
----

=== `pg_wal_monitor_interval`

How often to report changes to the replication lag.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `3s`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
pg_wal_monitor_interval: 6s
----

=== `schema`

The PostgreSQL schema from which to replicate data.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
schema: public

# ---

schema: "MyCaseSensitiveSchemaNeedingQuotes"
----

=== `slot_name`

The name of the PostgreSQL logical replication slot to use. If not provided, a random name will be generated. You can create this slot manually before starting replication if desired.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
slot_name: my_test_slot
----

=== `snapshot_batch_size`

The number of rows to fetch in each batch when querying the snapshot.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1000`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
snapshot_batch_size: 10000
----

=== `stream_snapshot`

When set to true, the plugin will first stream a snapshot of all existing data in the database before streaming changes. In order to use this the tables that are being snapshot MUST have a primary key set so that reading from the table can be parallelized.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
stream_snapshot: true
----

=== `tables[]`

A list of table names to include in the logical replication. Each table should be specified as a separate item.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
tables:
  - my_table_1

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar


# ---

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.
