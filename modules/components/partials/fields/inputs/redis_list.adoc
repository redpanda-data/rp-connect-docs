== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `command`

The command used to pop elements from the Redis list

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.22.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `blpop`

*Options*: `blpop`, `brpop`

=== `key`

The key of a list to read from.

*Type*: `string`

=== `kind`

Specifies a simple, cluster-aware, or failover-aware redis client.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `simple`

*Options*: `simple`, `cluster`, `failover`

=== `master`

Name of the redis master when `kind` is `failover`

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
master: mymaster

----

=== `max_in_flight`

Optionally sets a limit on the number of messages that can be flowing through a Redpanda Connect stream pending acknowledgment from the input at any given time. Once a message has been either acknowledged or rejected (nacked) it is no longer considered pending. If the input produces logical batches then each batch is considered a single count against the maximum. **WARNING**: Batching policies at the output level will stall if this field limits the number of messages below the batching threshold. Zero (default) or lower implies no limit.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.9.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `timeout`

The length of time to poll for new messages before reattempting.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

**Troubleshooting**

Some cloud hosted instances of Redis (such as Azure Cache) might need some hand holding in order to establish stable connections. Unfortunately, it is often the case that TLS issues will manifest as generic error messages such as "i/o timeout". If you're using TLS and are seeing connectivity problems consider setting `enable_renegotiation` to `true`, and ensuring that the server supports at least TLS version 1.2.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key

----

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.


include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
password: foo
password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}

----

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----

----

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem

----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `url`

The URL of the target Redis server. Database is optional and is supplied as the URL path.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
url: redis://:6379
url: redis://localhost:6379
url: redis://foousername:foopassword@redisplace:6379
url: redis://:foopassword@redisplace:6379
url: redis://localhost:6379/1
url: redis://localhost:6379/1,redis://localhost:6380/1
