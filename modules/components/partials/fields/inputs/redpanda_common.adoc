== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of rejections is persistent, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams, as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `commit_period`

The period of time between each commit of the current partition offsets. Offsets are always committed during shutdown.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `consumer_group`

An optional consumer group. When this value is specified: 

- The partitions of any topics, specified in the `topics` field, are automatically distributed across consumers sharing a consumer group
- Partition offsets are automatically committed and resumed under this name

Consumer groups are not supported when you specify explicit partitions to consume from in the `topics` field.

*Type*: `string`

=== `fetch_max_bytes`

The maximum number of bytes that a broker tries to send during a fetch. 

If individual records are larger than the `fetch_max_bytes` value, brokers will still send them.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `50MiB`

=== `fetch_max_partition_bytes`

The maximum number of bytes that are consumed from a single partition in a fetch request. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.max.partition.bytes`.

If a single batch is larger than the `fetch_max_partition_bytes` value, the batch is still sent so that the client can make progress.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1MiB`

=== `fetch_max_wait`

The maximum period of time a broker can wait for a fetch response to reach the required minimum number of bytes (`fetch_min_bytes`).

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `fetch_min_bytes`

The minimum number of bytes that a broker tries to send during a fetch. This field is equivalent to the Java setting `fetch.min.bytes`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1B`

=== `heartbeat_interval`

When you specify a `consumer_group`, `heartbeat_interval` sets how frequently a consumer group member should send heartbeats to Apache Kafka. Apache Kafka uses heartbeats to make sure that a group member's session is active. 

You must set `heartbeat_interval` to less than one-third of `session_timeout`.

This field is equivalent to the Java `heartbeat.interval.ms` setting and accepts Go duration format strings such as `10s` or `2m`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `3s`

=== `instance_id`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, assign a unique value to `instance_id` to define the group’s static membership, which can prevent unnecessary rebalances during reconnections. 

When you assign an instance ID, the client does not automatically leave the consumer group when it disconnects. To remove the client, you must use an external admin command on behalf of the instance ID.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `max_yield_batch_bytes`

The maximum size (in bytes) for each batch yielded by this input. When routed to a redpanda output without modification this would roughly translate to the batch.bytes config field of a traditional producer.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `32KB`

=== `partition_buffer_bytes`

A buffer size (in bytes) for each consumed partition, which allows the internal queuing of records before they are flushed. Increasing this value may improve throughput but results in higher memory utilization. 

Each buffer can grow slightly beyond this value.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1MB`

=== `rack_id`

A rack specifies where the client is physically located, and changes fetch requests to consume from the closest replica as opposed to the leader replica.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `rebalance_timeout`

When you specify a <<consumer_group,`consumer_group`>>, `rebalance_timeout` sets a time limit for all consumer group members to complete their work and commit offsets after a rebalance has begun. The timeout excludes the time taken to detect a failed or late heartbeat, which indicates a rebalance is required. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `45s`

=== `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics are interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions, this field must remain set to `false`.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `session_timeout`

When you specify a `consumer_group`, `session_timeout` sets the maximum interval between heartbeats sent by a consumer group member to the broker. If a broker doesn't receive a heartbeat from a group member before the timeout expires, it removes the member from the consumer group and initiates a rebalance. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1m`

=== `start_offset`

Specify the offset from which this input starts or restarts consuming messages. Restarts occur when the `OffsetOutOfRange` error is seen during a fetch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `earliest`

[cols="1m,2a"]
|===
|Option |Summary

|committed
|Prevents consuming a partition in a group if the partition has no prior commits. Corresponds to Kafka's `auto.offset.reset=none` option

|earliest
|Start from the earliest offset. Corresponds to Kafka's `auto.offset.reset=earliest` option.

|latest
|Start from the latest offset. Corresponds to Kafka's `auto.offset.reset=latest` option.

|===

=== `topic_lag_refresh_period`

The interval between refresh cycles. During each cycle, this input queries the Redpanda Connect server to calculate the topic lag minus the number of produced messages that remain to be read from each topic/partition pair by the specified consumer group. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `topics[]`

A list of topics to consume from. Use commas to separate multiple topics in a single element.

When a `consumer_group` is specified, partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Otherwise, all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, you can specify explicit partitions to consume by using a colon after the topic name. For example, `foo:0` would consume the partition `0` of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges. For example, `foo:0-10` would consume partitions `0` through to `10` inclusive.

It is also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition. For example, `foo:0:10` would consume the partition `0` of the topic `foo` starting from the offset `10`. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_offset` determines which offset to start from.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
topics:
  - foo
  - bar

  - things.*

  - "foo,bar"

  - "foo:0"
  - "bar:1"
  - "bar:3"

  - "foo:0,bar:1,bar:3"

  - "foo:0-5"

----

=== `transaction_isolation_level`

The isolation level for handling transactional messages. This setting determines how transactions are processed and affects data consistency guarantees.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `read_uncommitted`

[cols="1m,2a"]
|===
|Option |Summary

|read_committed
|If set, only committed transactional records are processed.

|read_uncommitted
|If set, then uncommitted records are processed.
