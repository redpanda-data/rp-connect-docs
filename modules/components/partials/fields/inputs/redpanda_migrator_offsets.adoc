== Fields

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of rejections is persistent, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams, as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `client_id`

An identifier for the client connection.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `benthos`

=== `conn_idle_timeout`

The rough amount of time to allow connections to idle before they are closed.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `20s`

=== `metadata_max_age`

The maximum period of time (in minutes) after which metadata is refreshed.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5m`

=== `poll_interval`

Duration between OffsetFetch polling attempts.

*Type*: `string`

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `regexp_topics`

Whether listed topics are interpreted as regular expression patterns for matching multiple topics. When topics are specified with explicit partitions, this field must remain set to `false`.

*Type*: `bool`

=== `request_timeout_overhead`

The request time overhead. Uses the given time as overhead while deadlining requests. Roughly equivalent to request.timeout.ms, but grants additional time to requests that have timeout fields.

*Default*: `10s`

=== `sasl[]`

Specify one or more methods of SASL authentication, which are attempted in order. If the broker supports the first mechanism, all connections use that mechanism.

----

=== `tls`

Override system defaults with custom TLS settings.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. Configure this field to enable mTLS and authenticate the client to the server using certificates. For each certificate, specify values for either the `cert` and `key` fields, or the `cert_file` and `key_file` fields.

*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `[]`

[source,yaml]

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

# Examples:
password: foo
password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}

endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `topics[]`

A list of topics to consume from. Use commas to separate multiple topics in a single element.

When a `consumer_group` is specified, partitions are automatically distributed across consumers of a topic. Otherwise, all partitions are consumed.

Alternatively, you can specify explicit partitions to consume by using a colon after the topic name. For example, `foo:0` would consume the partition `0` of the topic foo. This syntax supports ranges. For example, `foo:0-10` would consume partitions `0` through to `10` inclusive.

It is also possible to specify an explicit offset to consume from by adding another colon after the partition. For example, `foo:0:10` would consume the partition `0` of the topic `foo` starting from the offset `10`. If the offset is not present (or remains unspecified) then the field `start_from_oldest` determines which offset to start from.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
topics:
  - foo
  - bar

  - things.*

  - "foo,bar"
