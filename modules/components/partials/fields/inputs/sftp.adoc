== Fields

=== `address`

The address (hostname or IP address) of the SFTP server to connect to.

*Type*: `string`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `connection_timeout`

The connection timeout to use when connecting to the target server.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `30s`

=== `credentials`

The credentials required to log in to the SFTP server. This can include a username and password, or a private key for secure access.

*Type*: `object`

=== `credentials.host_public_key`

The public key file of the SFTP server.

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.host_public_key_file`

The public key of the SFTP server.

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.password`

The password for the username used to authenticate with the SFTP server.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials.private_key`

The private key used to authenticate with the SFTP server. This field provides an alternative to the <<credentials-private_key_file, `private_key_file`>>.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.private_key_file`

The path to a private key file used to authenticate with the SFTP server. You can also provide a private key using the <<credentials-private_key,`private_key`>> field.

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.private_key_pass`

A passphrase for the private key.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `credentials.username`

The username required to authenticate with the SFTP server.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `delete_on_finish`

Whether to delete files from the server once they are processed.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `max_sftp_sessions`

The maximum number of SFTP sessions.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `10`

=== `paths[]`

A list of paths to consume sequentially. Glob patterns are supported.

*Type*: `array`

=== `scanner`

The xref:components:scanners/about.adoc[scanner] by which the stream of bytes consumed will be broken out into individual messages. Scanners are useful for processing large sources of data without holding the entirety of it within memory. For example, the `csv` scanner allows you to process individual CSV rows without loading the entire CSV file in memory at once.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.25.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `scanner`

*Default*:
[source,yaml]
----
to_the_end: {}
----

=== `watcher`

An experimental mode whereby the input will periodically scan the target paths for new files and consume them, when all files are consumed the input will continue polling for new files.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.42.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `object`

=== `watcher.cache`

A xref:components:caches/about.adoc[cache resource] for storing the paths of files already consumed.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `watcher.enabled`

Whether file watching is enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `watcher.minimum_age`

The minimum period of time since a file was last updated before attempting to consume it. Increasing this period decreases the likelihood that a file will be consumed whilst it is still being written to.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1s`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
minimum_age: 10s
minimum_age: 1m
minimum_age: 10m
----

=== `watcher.poll_interval`

The interval between each attempt to scan the target paths for new files.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1s`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
poll_interval: 100ms
poll_interval: 1s
