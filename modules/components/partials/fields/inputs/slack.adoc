== Fields

=== `app_token`

The app-level token to use to authenticate and connect to Slack.

*Type*: `string`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether to automatically replay messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level. If the cause of rejections is persistent, leaving this option enabled can result in back pressure.

Set `auto_replay_nacks` to `false` to delete rejected messages. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams, as the original shape of the data is discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

Your Slack bot user's OAuth token, which must have the https://api.slack.com/scopes/connections:write[`connections.write` scope^] to access your Slack app's https://api.slack.com/methods/apps.connections.open[Socket Mode WebSocket URL^].

*Type*: `string`
