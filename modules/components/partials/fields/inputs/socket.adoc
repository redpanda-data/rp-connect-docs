== Fields

=== `address`

The address to connect to.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
address: /tmp/benthos.sock
address: 127.0.0.1:6000
----

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `network`

A network type to assume (unix|tcp).

*Type*: `string`

*Options*: `unix`, `tcp`

=== `open_message_mapping`

An optional xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to a string which will be sent upstream before the downstream data flow starts.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
open_message_mapping: root = "username,password"
----

=== `scanner`

The xref:components:scanners/about.adoc[scanner] by which the stream of bytes consumed will be broken out into individual messages. Scanners are useful for processing large sources of data without holding the entirety of it within memory. For example, the `csv` scanner allows you to process individual CSV rows without loading the entire CSV file in memory at once.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.25.0 or later.

*Type*: `scanner`

*Default*:
