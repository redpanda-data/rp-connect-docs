== Fields

=== `args_mapping`

An optional xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to an array of values matching in size to the number of placeholder arguments in the field `where`.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
args_mapping: root = [ "article", now().ts_format("2006-01-02") ]
----

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `columns[]`

A list of columns to select.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
columns:
  - "*"

  - foo
  - bar
  - baz

----

=== `conn_max_idle`

An optional maximum number of connections in the idle connection pool. If conn_max_open is greater than 0 but less than the new conn_max_idle, then the new conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, no idle connections are retained. The default max idle connections is currently 2. This may change in a future release.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `2`

=== `conn_max_idle_time`

An optional maximum amount of time a connection may be idle. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse. If `value <= 0`, connections are not closed due to a connections idle time.

*Type*: `string`

=== `conn_max_life_time`

An optional maximum amount of time a connection may be reused. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse. If `value <= 0`, connections are not closed due to a connections age.

*Type*: `string`

=== `conn_max_open`

An optional maximum number of open connections to the database. If conn_max_idle is greater than 0 and the new conn_max_open is less than conn_max_idle, then conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the new conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, then there is no limit on the number of open connections. The default is 0 (unlimited).

*Type*: `int`

=== `driver`

A database <<drivers, driver>> to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Options*: `mysql`, `postgres`, `clickhouse`, `mssql`, `sqlite`, `oracle`, `snowflake`, `trino`, `gocosmos`, `spanner`

=== `dsn`

A Data Source Name to identify the target database.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
dsn: clickhouse://username:password@host1:9000,host2:9000/database?dial_timeout=200ms&max_execution_time=60
dsn: foouser:foopassword@tcp(localhost:3306)/foodb
dsn: postgres://foouser:foopass@localhost:5432/foodb?sslmode=disable
dsn: oracle://foouser:foopass@localhost:1521/service_name
----

=== `init_files[]`


An optional list of file paths containing SQL statements to execute immediately upon the first connection to the target database. This is a useful way to initialise tables before processing data. Glob patterns are supported, including super globs (double star).

Care should be taken to ensure that the statements are idempotent, and therefore would not cause issues when run multiple times after service restarts. If both `init_statement` and `init_files` are specified the `init_statement` is executed _after_ the `init_files`.

If a statement fails for any reason a warning log will be emitted but the operation of this component will not be stopped.


ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.10.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
init_files:
  - ./init/*.sql

  - ./foo.sql
  - ./bar.sql

----

=== `init_statement`


An optional SQL statement to execute immediately upon the first connection to the target database. This is a useful way to initialise tables before processing data. Care should be taken to ensure that the statement is idempotent, and therefore would not cause issues when run multiple times after service restarts.

If both `init_statement` and `init_files` are specified the `init_statement` is executed _after_ the `init_files`.

If the statement fails for any reason a warning log will be emitted but the operation of this component will not be stopped.


ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.10.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
init_statement: |-
  
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS some_table (
    foo varchar(50) not null,
    bar integer,
    baz varchar(50),
    primary key (foo)
  ) WITHOUT ROWID;
  
----

=== `prefix`

An optional prefix to prepend to the select query (before SELECT).

*Type*: `string`

=== `suffix`

An optional suffix to append to the select query.

*Type*: `string`

=== `table`

The table to select from.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
table: foo
----

=== `where`

An optional where clause to add. Placeholder arguments are populated with the `args_mapping` field. Placeholders should always be question marks, and will automatically be converted to dollar syntax when the postgres or clickhouse drivers are used.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
where: type = ? and created_at > ?
where: user_id = ?
