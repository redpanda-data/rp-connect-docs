== Fields

=== `addresses[]`

A list of IP addresses of all the TigerBeetle replicas in the cluster. The order of addresses must correspond to the order of replicas.

*Type*: `array`

=== `auto_replay_nacks`

Whether messages that are rejected (nacked) at the output level should be automatically replayed indefinitely, eventually resulting in back pressure if the cause of the rejections is persistent. If set to `false` these messages will instead be deleted. Disabling auto replays can greatly improve memory efficiency of high throughput streams as the original shape of the data can be discarded immediately upon consumption and mutation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `cluster_id`

The TigerBeetle unique 128-bit cluster ID.

*Type*: `string`

=== `event_count_max`

The maximum number of events fetched from TigerBeetle per **request**.
Must be greater than zero.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `2730`

=== `idle_interval_ms`

The time interval in milliseconds to wait before querying again when the last request returned no events.
Must be greater than zero.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `1000`

=== `progress_cache`

A https://docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-connect/components/caches/about[cache resource^] used to track progress by storing the last acknowledged timestamp.
This allows Redpanda Connect to resume from the latest delivered event upon restart.

*Type*: `string`

=== `rate_limit`

An optional https://docs.redpanda.com/redpanda-connect/components/rate_limits/about/[rate limit^] to throttle the number of **requests** made to TigerBeetle.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `timestamp_initial`

The initial timestamp to start extracting events from. If not defined, all events since the beginning will be included.
Ignored if a more recent timestamp has already been acknowledged.
This is a TigerBeetle timestamp with nanosecond precision.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`
