== Fields

=== `back_pressure`

An optional duration string that determines the maximum length of time to wait for a given message to be accepted by the child output before the message should be dropped instead. The most common reason for an output to block is when waiting for a lost connection to be re-established. Once a message has been dropped due to back pressure all subsequent messages are dropped immediately until the output is ready to process them again. Note that if `error` is set to `false` and this field is specified then messages dropped due to back pressure will return an error response (are nacked or reattempted).

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
back_pressure: 30s
back_pressure: 1m
----

=== `error`

Whether messages should be dropped when the child output returns an error of any type. For example, this could be when an `http_client` output gets a 4XX response code. In order to instead drop only on specific error patterns use the `error_matches` field instead.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `error_patterns[]`

A list of regular expressions (re2) where if the child output returns an error that matches any part of any of these patterns the message will be dropped.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.27.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
error_patterns:
  - and that was really bad$

  - "roughly [0-9]+ issues occurred"

----

=== `output`

A child output to wrap with this drop mechanism.

*Type*: `output`
