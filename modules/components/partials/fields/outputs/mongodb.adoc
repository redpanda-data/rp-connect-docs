== Fields

=== `app_name`

The client application name.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `benthos`

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

The number of bytes at which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable size-based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

The number of messages after which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable count-based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

The period of time after which an incomplete batch is flushed regardless of its size. This field accepts Go duration format strings such as `100ms`, `1s`, or `5s`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s

# ---

period: 1m

# ---

period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. All resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, and therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `collection`

The name of the target collection. This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

=== `database`

The name of the target MongoDB database.

*Type*: `string`

=== `document_map`

A Bloblang map that represents a document to store in MongoDB, expressed as https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/[extended JSON in canonical form^]. The `document_map` parameter is required for the following database operations: `insert-one`, `replace-one`, and `update-one`.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
document_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
----

=== `filter_map`

A Bloblang map that represents a filter for a MongoDB command, expressed as https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/[extended JSON in canonical form^]. The `filter_map` parameter is required for all database operations except `insert-one`. 

This output uses `filter_map` to find documents for the specified operation. For example, for a `delete-one` operation, the filter map should include the fields required to locate the document for deletion.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
filter_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
----

=== `hint_map`

A Bloblang map that represents a hint or index for a MongoDB command to use, expressed as https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/mongodb-extended-json/[extended JSON in canonical form^]. This map is optional, and is used with all operations except `insert-one`. 

Define a `hint_map` to improve performance when finding documents in the MongoDB database.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
hint_map: |-
  root.a = this.foo
  root.b = this.bar
----

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this number to improve throughput.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `operation`

The MongoDB database operation to perform.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `update-one`

*Options*: `insert-one`, `delete-one`, `delete-many`, `replace-one`, `update-one`

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `upsert`

The `upsert` parameter is optional, and only applies for `update-one` and `replace-one` operations. If the filter specified in `filter_map` matches an existing document, this operation updates or replaces the document, otherwise a new document is created.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.60.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `url`

The URL of the target MongoDB server.
