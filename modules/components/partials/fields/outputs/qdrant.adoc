== Fields

=== `api_token`

The Qdrant API token for authentication. Defaults to an empty string.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s
period: 1m
period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines

  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `collection_name`

The name of the collection in Qdrant.


*Type*: `string`

=== `grpc_host`

The gRPC host of the Qdrant server.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
grpc_host: localhost:6334
grpc_host: xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6334
----

=== `id`

The ID of the point to insert. Can be a UUID string or positive integer.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
id: root = "dc88c126-679f-49f5-ab85-04b77e8c2791"
id: root = 832
----

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `payload_mapping`

An optional mapping of message to payload associated with the point.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `root = {}`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
payload_mapping: root = {"field": this.value, "field_2": 987}
payload_mapping: root = metadata()
----

=== `tls`

Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings to secure network connections. This includes options for standard TLS as well as mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both client and server authenticate each other using certificates. Key configuration options include `enabled` to enable TLS, `client_certs` for mTLS authentication, `root_cas`/`root_cas_file` for custom certificate authorities, and `skip_cert_verify` for development environments.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.

*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `[]`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key

----

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.


include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
password: foo
password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
----

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `vector_mapping`

The mapping to extract the vector from the document.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
vector_mapping: root = {"dense_vector": [0.352,0.532,0.754],"sparse_vector": {"indices": [23,325,532],"values": [0.352,0.532,0.532]}, "multi_vector": [[0.352,0.532],[0.352,0.532]]}
vector_mapping: root = [1.2, 0.5, 0.76]
vector_mapping: root = this.vector
vector_mapping: root = [[0.352,0.532,0.532,0.234],[0.352,0.532,0.532,0.234]]
vector_mapping: root = {"some_sparse": {"indices":[23,325,532],"values":[0.352,0.532,0.532]}}
