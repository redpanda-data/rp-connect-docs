== Fields

=== `address`

The host and port of the QuestDB server.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
address: localhost:9000
----

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

The number of bytes at which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable size-based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that returns a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

The number of messages after which the batch is flushed. Set to `0` to disable count-based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

The period of time after which an incomplete batch is flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s
period: 1m
period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

For aggregating and archiving message batches, you can add a list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. All resulting messages are flushed as a single batch even when you configure processors to split the batch into smaller batches.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines

  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `designated_timestamp_field`

The name of the designated timestamp field in QuestDB.

*Type*: `string`

=== `designated_timestamp_unit`

Units used for the designated timestamp field in QuestDB.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `auto`

=== `doubles[]`

Columns that must be the `double` type, with `int` as the default.

*Type*: `array`

=== `error_on_empty_messages`

Mark a message as an error if it is empty after field validation.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this value to improve throughput.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `password`

The password to use for basic authentication.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

=== `request_min_throughput`

The minimum expected throughput in bytes per second for HTTP requests. If the throughput is lower than this value, the connection times out. The `quest_db` output uses this value to calculate an additional timeout on top of the `request_timeout`. This setting is useful for large requests. Set it to `0` to disable this logic.

*Type*: `int`

=== `request_timeout`

The period of time to wait for a response from the QuestDB server in addition to any connection timeout calculated for the `request_min_throughput` field.

*Type*: `string`

=== `retry_timeout`

The period of time to continue retrying after a failed HTTP request. The interval between retries is an exponential backoff starting at 10 ms, and doubling after each failed attempt up to a maximum of 1 second.

*Type*: `string`

=== `symbols[]`

Columns that must be the `symbol` type. String values default to `string` types.

*Type*: `array`

=== `table`

The destination table in QuestDB.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
table: trades
----

=== `timestamp_string_fields[]`

String fields with textual timestamps.

*Type*: `array`

=== `timestamp_string_format`

The timestamp format, which is used when parsing timestamp string fields and uses Golang's time formatting.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `Jan _2 15:04:05.000000Z0700`

=== `tls`

Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings to secure network connections. This includes options for standard TLS as well as mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both client and server authenticate each other using certificates.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. Configure this field to enable mTLS and authenticate the client to the server using certificates. Each certificate entry should specify either `cert` and `key` fields for inline certificates, or `cert_file` and `key_file` fields for certificate files stored on disk.

*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `[]`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key

----

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.


include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
password: foo
password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
----

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.root_cas`

Specify a root certificate authority to use (optional). This is a string that represents a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

Specify the path to a root certificate authority file (optional). This is a file, often with a `.pem` extension, which contains a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.certificate.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification. Set to `true` only for testing environments as this reduces security by disabling certificate validation. When using self-signed certificates or in development, this may be necessary, but should never be used in production.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `token`

The bearer token to use for authentication, which takes precedence over the basic authentication username and password.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

=== `username`

The username to use for basic authentication.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`
