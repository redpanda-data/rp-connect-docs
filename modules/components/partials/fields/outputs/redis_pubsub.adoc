== Fields

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s

# ---

batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s

# ---

period: 1m

# ---

period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: lines


# ---

processors:
  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `channel`

The channel to publish messages to.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

=== `kind`

Specifies a simple, cluster-aware, or failover-aware redis client.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `simple`

*Options*: `simple`, `cluster`, `failover`

=== `master`

Name of the redis master when `kind` is `failover`

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
master: mymaster
----

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increase this to improve throughput.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `tls`

Custom TLS settings can be used to override system defaults.

**Troubleshooting**

Some cloud hosted instances of Redis (such as Azure Cache) might need some hand holding in order to establish stable connections. Unfortunately, it is often the case that TLS issues will manifest as generic error messages such as "i/o timeout". If you're using TLS and are seeing connectivity problems consider setting `enable_renegotiation` to `true`, and ensuring that the server supports at least TLS version 1.2.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates to use. For each certificate either the fields `cert` and `key`, or `cert_file` and `key_file` should be specified, but not both.

*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `[]`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar


# ---

client_certs:
  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key

----

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.


include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
password: foo

# ---

password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
----

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to repeatedly request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: tls: no renegotiation`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.root_cas`

An optional root certificate authority to use. This is a string, representing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

An optional path of a root certificate authority file to use. This is a file, often with a .pem extension, containing a certificate chain from the parent trusted root certificate, to possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server side certificate verification.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `url`

The URL of the target Redis server. Database is optional and is supplied as the URL path.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
url: redis://:6379

# ---

url: redis://localhost:6379

# ---

url: redis://foousername:foopassword@redisplace:6379

# ---

url: redis://:foopassword@redisplace:6379

# ---

url: redis://localhost:6379/1

# ---

url: redis://localhost:6379/1,redis://localhost:6380/1
