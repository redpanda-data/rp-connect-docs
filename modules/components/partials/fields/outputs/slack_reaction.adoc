== Fields

=== `action`

Whether to add or remove the reaction. When set to `add`, the specified emoji reaction is applied to the target message. When set to `remove`, the emoji reaction is removed from the target message.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `add`

*Options*: `add`, `remove`

=== `bot_token`

Your Slack Bot User OAuth token used to authenticate the API request. This token must have the necessary `reactions:write` and `channels:read` (or related) scopes. It typically begins with `xoxb-`.

*Type*: `string`

=== `channel_id`

The unique Slack channel ID where the target message resides. Channel IDs usually start with `C` for public channels or `G` for private channels. This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

=== `emoji`

The name of the emoji to be added or removed, without surrounding colons. Use the plain emoji name, such as `thumbsup` or `tada`. This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of messages to have in flight at a given time. Increasing this value can improve throughput in high-volume scenarios, but be cautious not to exceed Slack's API rate limits.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `timestamp`

The timestamp of the message to react to. This is a unique identifier for the message, usually obtained from a previous Slack API call (such as `chat.postMessage` or `conversations.history`). It typically looks like a Unix timestamp with a decimal. This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`
