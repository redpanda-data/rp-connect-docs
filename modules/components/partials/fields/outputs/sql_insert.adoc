== Fields

=== `args_mapping`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to an array of values matching in size to the number of columns specified.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
args_mapping: root = [ this.cat.meow, this.doc.woofs[0] ]
args_mapping: root = [ meta("user.id") ]
----

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s
period: 1m
period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines

  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `columns[]`

A list of columns to insert.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
columns:
  - foo
  - bar
  - baz

----

=== `conn_max_idle`

An optional maximum number of connections in the idle connection pool. If conn_max_open is greater than 0 but less than the new conn_max_idle, then the new conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, no idle connections are retained. The default max idle connections is currently 2. This may change in a future release.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `2`

=== `conn_max_idle_time`

An optional maximum amount of time a connection may be idle. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse. If `value <= 0`, connections are not closed due to a connections idle time.

*Type*: `string`

=== `conn_max_life_time`

An optional maximum amount of time a connection may be reused. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse. If `value <= 0`, connections are not closed due to a connections age.

*Type*: `string`

=== `conn_max_open`

An optional maximum number of open connections to the database. If conn_max_idle is greater than 0 and the new conn_max_open is less than conn_max_idle, then conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the new conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, then there is no limit on the number of open connections. The default is 0 (unlimited).

*Type*: `int`

=== `driver`

A database <<drivers, driver>> to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Options*: `mysql`, `postgres`, `clickhouse`, `mssql`, `sqlite`, `oracle`, `snowflake`, `trino`, `gocosmos`, `spanner`

=== `dsn`

The Data Source Name (DSN) connection string that identifies the target database. The DSN format varies by database type and typically includes connection details like host, port, database name, and authentication parameters.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
dsn: clickhouse://username:password@host1:9000,host2:9000/database?dial_timeout=200ms&max_execution_time=60
dsn: foouser:foopassword@tcp(localhost:3306)/foodb
dsn: postgres://foouser:foopass@localhost:5432/foodb?sslmode=disable
dsn: oracle://foouser:foopass@localhost:1521/service_name
----

=== `init_files[]`


An optional list of file paths containing SQL statements to execute immediately upon the first connection to the target database. This is a useful way to initialise tables before processing data. Glob patterns are supported, including super globs (double star).

Care should be taken to ensure that the statements are idempotent, and therefore would not cause issues when run multiple times after service restarts. If both `init_statement` and `init_files` are specified the `init_statement` is executed _after_ the `init_files`.

If a statement fails for any reason a warning log will be emitted but the operation of this component will not be stopped.


ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.10.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
init_files:
  - ./init/*.sql

  - ./foo.sql
  - ./bar.sql

----

=== `init_statement`


An optional SQL statement to execute immediately upon the first connection to the target database. This is a useful way to initialise tables before processing data. Care should be taken to ensure that the statement is idempotent, and therefore would not cause issues when run multiple times after service restarts.

If both `init_statement` and `init_files` are specified the `init_statement` is executed _after_ the `init_files`.

If the statement fails for any reason a warning log will be emitted but the operation of this component will not be stopped.


ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.10.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
init_statement: |-
  
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS some_table (
    foo varchar(50) not null,
    bar integer,
    baz varchar(50),
    primary key (foo)
  ) WITHOUT ROWID;
  
----

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of inserts to run in parallel.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `options[]`

A list of keyword options to add before the INTO clause of the query.

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
options:
  - DELAYED
  - IGNORE

----

=== `prefix`

An optional prefix to prepend to the insert query (before INSERT).

*Type*: `string`

=== `suffix`

An optional suffix to append to the insert query.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
suffix: ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING
----

=== `table`

The table to insert to.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
table: foo
