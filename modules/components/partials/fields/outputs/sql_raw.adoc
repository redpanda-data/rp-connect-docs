== Fields

=== `args_mapping`

An optional xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] that includes the same number of values in an array as the placeholder arguments in the <<query, `query`>> field.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
args_mapping: root = [ this.cat.meow, this.doc.woofs[0] ]
args_mapping: root = [ meta("user.id") ]
----

=== `batching`


Allows you to configure a xref:configuration:batching.adoc[batching policy].

*Type*: `object`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
batching:
  byte_size: 5000
  count: 0
  period: 1s
batching:
  count: 10
  period: 1s
batching:
  check: this.contains("END BATCH")
  count: 0
  period: 1m
----

=== `batching.byte_size`

An amount of bytes at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables size based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.check`

A xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang query] that should return a boolean value indicating whether a message should end a batch.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
check: this.type == "end_of_transaction"
----

=== `batching.count`

A number of messages at which the batch should be flushed. If `0` disables count based batching.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `batching.period`

A period in which an incomplete batch should be flushed regardless of its size.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
period: 1s
period: 1m
period: 500ms
----

=== `batching.processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to apply to a batch as it is flushed. This allows you to aggregate and archive the batch however you see fit. Please note that all resulting messages are flushed as a single batch, therefore splitting the batch into smaller batches using these processors is a no-op.

*Type*: `processor`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
processors:
  - archive:
      format: concatenate

  - archive:
      format: lines

  - archive:
      format: json_array

----

=== `conn_max_idle`

An optional maximum number of connections in the idle connection pool. If conn_max_open is greater than 0 but less than the new conn_max_idle, then the new conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, no idle connections are retained. The default max idle connections is currently 2. This may change in a future release.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `2`

=== `conn_max_idle_time`

An optional maximum amount of time a connection may be idle. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse. If `value <= 0`, connections are not closed due to a connections idle time.

*Type*: `string`

=== `conn_max_life_time`

An optional maximum amount of time a connection may be reused. Expired connections may be closed lazily before reuse. If `value <= 0`, connections are not closed due to a connections age.

*Type*: `string`

=== `conn_max_open`

An optional maximum number of open connections to the database. If conn_max_idle is greater than 0 and the new conn_max_open is less than conn_max_idle, then conn_max_idle will be reduced to match the new conn_max_open limit. If `value <= 0`, then there is no limit on the number of open connections. The default is 0 (unlimited).

*Type*: `int`

=== `driver`

A database <<drivers, driver>> to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Options*: `mysql`, `postgres`, `clickhouse`, `mssql`, `sqlite`, `oracle`, `snowflake`, `trino`, `gocosmos`, `spanner`

=== `dsn`

A Data Source Name to identify the target database.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
dsn: clickhouse://username:password@host1:9000,host2:9000/database?dial_timeout=200ms&max_execution_time=60
dsn: foouser:foopassword@tcp(localhost:3306)/foodb
dsn: postgres://foouser:foopass@localhost:5432/foodb?sslmode=disable
dsn: oracle://foouser:foopass@localhost:1521/service_name
----

=== `init_files[]`


An optional list of file paths containing SQL statements to execute immediately upon the first connection to the target database. This is a useful way to initialise tables before processing data. Glob patterns are supported, including super globs (double star).

Care should be taken to ensure that the statements are idempotent, and therefore would not cause issues when run multiple times after service restarts. If both `init_statement` and `init_files` are specified the `init_statement` is executed _after_ the `init_files`.

If a statement fails for any reason a warning log will be emitted but the operation of this component will not be stopped.


ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.10.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `array`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
init_files:
  - ./init/*.sql

  - ./foo.sql
  - ./bar.sql

----

=== `init_statement`


An optional SQL statement to execute immediately upon the first connection to the target database. This is a useful way to initialise tables before processing data. Care should be taken to ensure that the statement is idempotent, and therefore would not cause issues when run multiple times after service restarts.

If both `init_statement` and `init_files` are specified the `init_statement` is executed _after_ the `init_files`.

If the statement fails for any reason a warning log will be emitted but the operation of this component will not be stopped.


ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.10.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
init_statement: |-
  
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS some_table (
    foo varchar(50) not null,
    bar integer,
    baz varchar(50),
    primary key (foo)
  ) WITHOUT ROWID;
  
----

=== `max_in_flight`

The maximum number of database statements to execute in parallel.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `64`

=== `queries[]`

A list of database statements to run in addition to your main <<query, `query`>>. If you specify multiple queries, they are executed within a single transaction. For more information, see <<Examples, Examples>>.

*Type*: `object`

=== `queries[].args_mapping`

An optional xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping] which should evaluate to an array of values matching in size to the number of placeholder arguments in the field `query`.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
args_mapping: root = [ this.cat.meow, this.doc.woofs[0] ]
args_mapping: root = [ meta("user.id") ]
----

=== `queries[].query`

The query to execute. The style of placeholder to use depends on the driver, some drivers require question marks (`?`) whereas others expect incrementing dollar signs (`$1`, `$2`, and so on) or colons (`:1`, `:2` and so on). The style to use is outlined in this table:

| Driver | Placeholder Style |
|---|---|
| `clickhouse` | Dollar sign |
| `mysql` | Question mark |
| `postgres` | Dollar sign |
| `mssql` | Question mark |
| `sqlite` | Question mark |
| `oracle` | Colon |
| `snowflake` | Question mark |
| `trino` | Question mark |
| `gocosmos` | Colon |


*Type*: `string`

=== `query`

The query to execute. 

You must include the correct placeholders for the specified database driver. Some drivers use question marks (`?`), whereas others expect incrementing dollar signs (`$1`, `$2`, and so on) or colons (`:1`, `:2`, and so on). 

include::components:partial$query_table.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
query: INSERT INTO footable (foo, bar, baz) VALUES (?, ?, ?);
----

=== `unsafe_dynamic_query`

Whether to enable xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions] in the query. Great care should be made to ensure your queries are defended against injection attacks.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`
