== Fields

=== `credentials`

Manually configure the AWS credentials to use (optional). For more information, see the xref:guides:cloud/aws.adoc[Amazon Web Services guide].

*Type*: `object`

=== `credentials.from_ec2_role`

Use the credentials of a host EC2 machine configured to assume https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2.html[an IAM role associated with the instance^].

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 4.2.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

=== `credentials.id`

The ID of the AWS credentials to use.

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.profile`

The profile from `~/.aws/credentials` to use.

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.role`

The role ARN to assume.

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.role_external_id`

An external ID to use when assuming a role.

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.secret`

The secret for the AWS credentials in use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

=== `credentials.token`

The token for the AWS credentials in use. This is a required value for short-term credentials.

*Type*: `string`

=== `endpoint`

A custom endpoint URL for AWS API requests. Use this to connect to AWS-compatible services or local testing environments instead of the standard AWS endpoints.

*Type*: `string`

=== `model`

The ID of the LLM that you want to use to generate vector embeddings. For a full list, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html[AWS Bedrock documentation^].

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
model: amazon.titan-embed-text-v1

# ---

model: amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0

# ---

model: cohere.embed-english-v3

# ---

model: cohere.embed-multilingual-v3
----

=== `region`

The region in which your AWS resources are hosted.

*Type*: `string`

=== `tcp`

Configure TCP socket-level settings to optimize network performance and reliability. These low-level controls are useful for:

- **High-latency networks**: Increase `connect_timeout` to allow more time for connection establishment
- **Long-lived connections**: Configure `keep_alive` settings to detect and recover from stale connections
- **Unstable networks**: Tune keep-alive probes to balance between quick failure detection and avoiding false positives
- **Linux systems with specific requirements**: Use `tcp_user_timeout` (Linux 2.6.37+) to control data acknowledgment timeouts

Most users should keep the default values. Only modify these settings if you're experiencing connection stability issues or have specific network requirements.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tcp.connect_timeout`

Maximum amount of time a dial will wait for a connect to complete. Zero disables.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `0s`

=== `tcp.keep_alive`

TCP keep-alive probe configuration.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.count`

Maximum unanswered keep-alive probes before dropping the connection. Zero defaults to 9.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `9`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.idle`

Duration the connection must be idle before sending the first keep-alive probe. Zero defaults to 15s. Negative values disable keep-alive probes.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `15s`

=== `tcp.keep_alive.interval`

Duration between keep-alive probes. Zero defaults to 15s.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `15s`

=== `tcp.tcp_user_timeout`

Maximum time to wait for acknowledgment of transmitted data before killing the connection. Linux-only (kernel 2.6.37+), ignored on other platforms. When enabled, keep_alive.idle must be greater than this value per RFC 5482. Zero disables.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `0s`

=== `text`

The prompt you want to generate a vector embedding for. The processor submits the entire payload as a string.

*Type*: `string`
