== Fields

=== `count_bytes`

Whether to measure the number of bytes per second of throughput. If set to `true`, Redpanda Connect must serialize structured data to count the number of bytes processed, which can unnecessarily degrade performance if serialization is not required elsewhere in your pipeline.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `true`

=== `interval`

How often to emit rolling statistics. Set to `0`, if you only want to log summary statistics when the processor shuts down.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`
