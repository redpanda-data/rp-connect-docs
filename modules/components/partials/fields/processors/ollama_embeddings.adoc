== Fields

=== `cache_directory`

If `server_address` is not set - the directory to download the ollama binary and use as a model cache.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
cache_directory: /opt/cache/connect/ollama
----

=== `download_url`

If `server_address` is not set - the URL to download the ollama binary from. Defaults to the offical Ollama GitHub release for this platform.

*Type*: `string`

=== `model`

The name of the Ollama LLM to use. For a full list of models, see the https://ollama.com/models[Ollama website].

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
model: nomic-embed-text
model: mxbai-embed-large
model: snowflake-artic-embed
model: all-minilm
----

=== `runner`

Options for the model runner that are used when the model is first loaded into memory.

*Type*: `object`

=== `runner.batch_size`

The maximum number of requests to process in parallel.

*Type*: `int`

=== `runner.context_size`

Sets the size of the context window used to generate the next token. Using a larger context window uses more memory and takes longer to processor.

*Type*: `int`

=== `runner.gpu_layers`

This option allows offloading some layers to the GPU for computation. This generally results in increased performance. By default, the runtime decides the number of layers dynamically.

*Type*: `int`

=== `runner.threads`

Set the number of threads to use during generation. For optimal performance, it is recommended to set this value to the number of physical CPU cores your system has. By default, the runtime decides the optimal number of threads.

*Type*: `int`

=== `runner.use_mmap`

Map the model into memory. This is only support on unix systems and allows loading only the necessary parts of the model as needed.

*Type*: `bool`

=== `server_address`

The address of the Ollama server to use. Leave the field blank and the processor starts and runs a local Ollama server or specify the address of your own local or remote server.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
server_address: http://127.0.0.1:11434
----

=== `text`

The text you want to create vector embeddings for. By default, the processor submits the entire payload as a string.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`
