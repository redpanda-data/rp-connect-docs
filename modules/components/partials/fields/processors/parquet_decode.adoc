== Fields

=== `handle_logical_types`

Set to `v2` to enable enhanced decoding of logical types, or keep the default value (`v1`) to ignore logical type metadata when decoding values.

In Parquet format, logical types are represented using standard physical types along with metadata that provides additional context. For example, UUIDs are stored as a `FIXED_LEN_BYTE_ARRAY` physical type, but the schema metadata identifies them as UUIDs. By enabling `v2`, this processor uses the metadata descriptions of logical types to produce more meaningful values during decoding.

NOTE: For backward compatibility, this field enables logical-type handling for the specified Parquet format version, and all earlier versions. When creating new pipelines, Redpanda recommends that you use the newest documented version.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `v1`

|Option |Summary

|v1
|No special handling of logical types

|v2
|
- TIMESTAMP - decodes as an RFC3339 string describing the time. If the `isAdjustedToUTC` flag is set to true in the parquet file, the time zone will be set to UTC. If it is set to false the time zone will be set to local time.
- UUID - decodes as a string, i.e. `00112233-4455-6677-8899-aabbccddeeff`.
