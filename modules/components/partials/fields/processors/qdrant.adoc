== Fields

=== `api_token`

The Qdrant API token to use for authentication, which defaults to an empty string.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `collection_name`

The name of the Qdrant collection you want to query. This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

=== `filter`

Specify additional filtering to perform on returned results. Mappings must return https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/filtering/[a valid filter^] using the proto3-encoded form.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
filter: |-
  
  root.must = [
  	{"has_id":{"has_id":[{"num": 8}, { "uuid":"1234-5678-90ab-cdef" }]}},
  	{"field":{"key": "city", "match": {"text": "London"}}},
  ]
  
filter: |-
  
  root.must = [
  	{"field":{"key": "city", "match": {"text": "London"}}},
  ]
  root.must_not = [
  	{"field":{"color": "city", "match": {"text": "red"}}},
  ]
  
----

=== `grpc_host`

The gRPC host of the Qdrant server.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
grpc_host: localhost:6334
grpc_host: xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6334
----

=== `limit`

The maximum number of points to return from the collection.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `10`

=== `payload_fields[]`

The fields to include or exclude in returned results. Use this field in combination with `payload_filter`.

*Type*: `array`

*Default*: `[]`

=== `payload_filter`

Whether to include or exclude the fields specified in `payload_fields` from the returned results.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `include`

[cols="1m,2a"]
|===
|Option |Summary

|exclude
|Exclude the payload fields specified in `payload_fields`.

|include
|Include the payload fields specified in `payload_fields`.

|===

=== `tls`

Configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings to secure network connections. This includes options for standard TLS as well as mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both client and server authenticate each other using certificates. Key configuration options include `enabled` to enable TLS, `client_certs` for mTLS authentication, `root_cas`/`root_cas_file` for custom certificate authorities, and `skip_cert_verify` for development environments.

*Type*: `object`

=== `tls.client_certs[]`

A list of client certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication. Configure this field to enable mTLS, authenticating the client to the server with these certificates.

You must set `tls.enabled: true` for the client certificates to take effect.

**Certificate pairing rules**: For each certificate item, provide either:

- Inline PEM data using both `cert` *and* `key` or
- File paths using both `cert_file` *and* `key_file`.

Mixing inline and file-based values within the same item is not supported.

*Type*: `object`

*Default*: `[]`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
client_certs:
  - cert: foo
    key: bar

  - cert_file: ./example.pem
    key_file: ./example.key

----

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert`

A plain text certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].cert_file`

The path of a certificate to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key`

A plain text certificate key to use.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].key_file`

The path of a certificate key to use.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `tls.client_certs[].password`

A plain text password for when the private key is password encrypted in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. The obsolete `pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC` algorithm is not supported for the PKCS#8 format.

Because the obsolete pbeWithMD5AndDES-CBC algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext, it is vulnerable to padding oracle attacks that can let an attacker recover the plaintext.


include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
password: foo
password: ${KEY_PASSWORD}
----

=== `tls.enable_renegotiation`

Whether to allow the remote server to request renegotiation. Enable this option if you're seeing the error message `local error: 
tls: no renegotiation`.

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Requires version 3.45.0 or later.
endif::[]

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.enabled`

Whether custom TLS settings are enabled.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `tls.root_cas`

Specify a root certificate authority to use (optional). This is a string that represents a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. Use either this field for inline certificate data or `root_cas_file` for file-based certificate loading.

include::redpanda-connect:components:partial$secret_warning.adoc[]

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
----

=== `tls.root_cas_file`

Specify the path to a root certificate authority file (optional). This is a file, often with a `.pem` extension, which contains a certificate chain from the parent-trusted root certificate, through possible intermediate signing certificates, to the host certificate. Use either this field for file-based certificate loading or `root_cas` for inline certificate data.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
root_cas_file: ./root_cas.pem
----

=== `tls.skip_cert_verify`

Whether to skip server-side certificate verification. Set to `true` only for testing environments as this reduces security by disabling certificate validation. When using self-signed certificates or in development, this may be necessary, but should never be used in production. Consider using `root_cas` or `root_cas_file` to specify trusted certificates instead of disabling verification entirely.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `vector_mapping`

A mapping to extract search vectors from the returned document.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
vector_mapping: root = [1.2, 0.5, 0.76]
vector_mapping: root = this.vector
vector_mapping: root = [[0.352,0.532,0.532,0.234],[0.352,0.532,0.532,0.234]]
vector_mapping: root = {"some_sparse": {"indices":[23,325,532],"values":[0.352,0.532,0.532]}}
vector_mapping: root = {"some_multi": [[0.352,0.532,0.532,0.234],[0.352,0.532,0.532,0.234]]}
vector_mapping: root = {"some_dense": [0.352,0.532,0.532,0.234]}
