== Fields

=== `backoff`

Determine time intervals and cut offs for retry attempts.

*Type*: `object`

=== `backoff.initial_interval`

The initial period to wait between retry attempts. The retry interval increases for each failed attempt, up to the `backoff.max_interval` value.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `500ms`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
initial_interval: 50ms
initial_interval: 1s
----

=== `backoff.max_elapsed_time`

The maximum overall period of time to spend on retry attempts before the request is aborted. Setting this value to a zeroed duration (such as `0s`) will result in unbounded retries.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `1m`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
max_elapsed_time: 1m
max_elapsed_time: 1h
----

=== `backoff.max_interval`

The maximum period to wait between retry attempts

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `10s`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
max_interval: 5s
max_interval: 1m
----

=== `max_retries`

The maximum number of retry attempts before the request is aborted. Setting this value to `0` will result in unbounded number of retries.

*Type*: `int`

*Default*: `0`

=== `parallel`

When processing batches of messages these batches are ignored and the processors apply to each message sequentially. However, when this field is set to `true` each message will be processed in parallel. Caution should be made to ensure that batch sizes do not surpass a point where this would cause resource (CPU, memory, API limits) contention.

*Type*: `bool`

*Default*: `false`

=== `processors[]`

A list of xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processors] to execute on each message.

*Type*: `processor`
