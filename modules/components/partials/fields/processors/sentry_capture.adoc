== Fields

=== `context`

A mapping that must evaluate to an object-of-objects or `deleted()`. If this mapping produces a value, then it is set on a sentry event as additional context.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
context: root = {"order": {"product_id": "P93174", "quantity": 5}}
context: root = deleted()
----

=== `dsn`

The DSN address to send sentry events to. If left empty, then SENTRY_DSN is used.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `environment`

The environment to be sent with events. If left empty, then SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT is used.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `extras`

A mapping that must evaluate to an object. If this mapping produces a value, then it is set on a sentry event as extras.

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
extras: root.foo = "bar"
extras: root = this.without("password")
----

=== `flush_timeout`

The duration to wait when closing the processor to flush any remaining enqueued events.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `5s`

=== `level`

Sets the level on sentry events similar to logging levels.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `INFO`

*Options*: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`

=== `message`

A message to set on the sentry event
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

[source,yaml]
----
# Examples:
message: webhook event received
message: failed to find product in database: ${! error() }
----

=== `release`

The version of the code deployed to an environment. If left empty, then the Sentry client will attempt to detect the release from the environment.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `""`

=== `sampling_rate`

The rate at which events are sent to the server. A value of 0 disables capturing sentry events entirely. A value of 1 results in sending all events to Sentry. Any value in between results sending some percentage of events.

*Type*: `float`

*Default*: `1`

=== `tags`

Sets key/value string tags on an event. Unlike context, these are indexed and searchable on Sentry but have length limitations.
This field supports xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc#bloblang-queries[interpolation functions].

*Type*: `string`

=== `transport_mode`

Determines how events are sent. A sync transport will block when sending each event until a response is received from the Sentry server. The recommended async transport will enqueue events in a buffer and send them in the background.

*Type*: `string`

*Default*: `async`

*Options*: `async`, `sync`
