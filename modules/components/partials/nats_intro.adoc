== Connection name

When monitoring and managing a production https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/overview[NATS system^], it is often useful to know which connection a message was sent or received from. To achieve this, set the connection name option when creating a NATS connection. Redpanda Connect can then automatically set the connection name to the NATS component label, so that monitoring tools between NATS and Redpanda Connect can stay in sync.


== Authentication

A number of Redpanda Connect components use NATS services. Each of these components
support optional, advanced authentication parameters for https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKeys^] and https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/creds[user credentials^].

For an in-depth guide, see the https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/security/jwt[NATS documentation^].

=== NKeys

NATS server can use NKeys in several ways for authentication. The simplest approach is to configure the server 
with a list of user's public keys. The server can then generate a challenge for each connection request from a client, and the client must respond to the challenge by signing it with its private NKey, configured in the `nkey_file` or `nkey` field.

For more details, see the https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NATS documentation^].

=== User credentials

NATS server also supports decentralized authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). When a server is configured to use this authentication scheme, clients need a https://docs.nats.io/nats-server/configuration/securing_nats/jwt#json-web-tokens[user JWT^]
and a corresponding https://docs.nats.io/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro/nkey_auth[NKey secret^] to connect.

You can use either of the following methods to supply the user JWT and NKey secret:

* In the `user_credentials_file` field, enter the path to a file containing both the private key and the JWT. You can generate the file using the https://docs.nats.io/nats-tools/nsc[nsc tool^].
* In the `user_jwt` field, enter a plain text JWT, and in the `user_nkey_seed` field, enter
the plain text NKey seed or private key.

For more details about authentication using JWTs, see the https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/developer/connecting/creds[NATS documentation^].
