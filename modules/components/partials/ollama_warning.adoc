NOTE: Ollama connectors are currently only available on BYOC GCP clusters.

[CAUTION]
====
When Redpanda Connect runs a data pipeline with a Ollama processor in it, Redpanda Cloud deploys a GPU-powered instance for the exclusive use of that pipeline. As pricing is based on resource consumption, this can have cost implications.
