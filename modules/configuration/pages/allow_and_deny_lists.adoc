= Configure an Allow or Deny List
:description: Learn how to configure an allow or deny list for a Redpanda Connect instance.

You can configure an allow or deny list to limit the Redpanda Connect components that users can run within data pipelines on a Redpanda Connect instance.

Introduced in version 4.39.0.

== Limitations

- You can configure only one allow list, or one deny list per Redpanda Connect instance.
- When you add the name of a component to your allow or deny list, you grant or block access to all related components. For example, if you include `aws_s3` in your list, you grant or block access to the entire `aws_s3` family of components, including the cache, input, and output.

== Configure an allow list

Configure an allow list to let users run only a subset of named components on your Redpanda Connect instance.

. Create a `connector_list.yaml` file in the following location: `/etc/redpanda/connector_list.yaml`.
. In the xref:components:catalog.adoc[Connector Catalog], find the exact name of the component family you want to grant access to. For example: `aws_s3` and `azure_cosmosdb`.
. Add the names of the component families to the `connector_list.yaml` file, using the following format:

+
```yaml
allow:
  - aws_s3
  - azure_cosmosdb
```
. Save your configuration.

== Configure a deny list

Configure a deny list to block users from running a subset of named components on your Redpanda Connect instance.

. Create a `connector_list.yaml` file in the following location: `/etc/redpanda/connector_list.yaml`.
. In the xref:components:catalog.adoc[Connector Catalog], find the exact name of the component family you want to block access to. For example: `aws_s3` and `azure_cosmosdb`.
. Add the names of the component families to the `connector_list.yaml` file, using the following format:

+
```yaml
deny:
  - aws_s3
  - azure_cosmosdb
```
. Save your configuration.
