= Secrets

This topic outlines how to add secrets to a Redpanda Connect configuration without exposing them.

== Using environment variables

One of the most prolific approaches to providing secrets to a service is via environment variables. {page-component-title} allows you to inject the values of environment variables into a configuration with the interpolation syntax `+${FOO}+`, within a configuration it looks like this:

[source,yml]
----
thing:
  super_secret: "${SECRET}"
----

[NOTE]
.Use quotes
====
Note that it would be valid to have `+super_secret: ${SECRET}+` above (without the quotes), but if `SECRET` is unset then the configuration becomes structurally different. Therefore, it's always best to wrap environment variable interpolations with quotes so that when the variable is unset you still have a valid configuration (with an empty string).
====

More information about this syntax can be found on the xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc[interpolation field page].

== Using CLI flags

As an alternative to environment variables, you can set specific fields within a configuration using the CLI flag `--set`, where the syntax is a `<path>=<value>` pair:

* `<path>`: A placeholder for the xref:configuration:field_paths.adoc[dot-separated path to the field being set].
* `<value>`: The value you want to set the field to. 

For example, to write data to a AWS DynamoDB table using the xref:components:outputs/aws_dynamodb.adoc[`aws_dynamodb`output connector], your configuration might look like this:

[source,yml]
----
output:
  label: ""
  aws_dynamodb:
    table: connect-db-test
    string_columns:
      id: ${!json("id")}
      full_content: ${!content()}

    batching:
      count: 5
      period: 2m

    credentials:
      id: ACCESS_KEY_ID
      secret: SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
----

You could set your credentials to values stored within something like Hashicorp Vault by running the configuration with the `--set` flag and backticks to execute shell commands for the values:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rpk connect run ./config.yaml \
  --set "output.aws_dynamodb.credentials.id=`vault kv get -mount=secret access_key_id`" \
  --set "output.aws_dynamodb.credentials.secret=`vault kv get -mount=secret secret_access_key`"
----

Using this method lets you inject the secret into the configuration without leaking it into an environment variable.

== Avoiding leaked secrets

There are a few ways in which configurations parsed by {page-component-title} can be exported back out of the service. In all of these cases {page-component-title} will attempt to scrub any field values within the config that are known secrets (any field marked as a secret in the docs).

However, if you're embedding secrets within a configuration outside of the value of secret fields, maybe as part of a Bloblang mapping, then care should be made to avoid exposing the resulting configuration. This specifically means you should not enable xref:components:http/about.adoc#debug-endpoints[debug HTTP endpoints] when the port is exposed, and don't use the `rpk connect echo` subcommand on configurations containing secrets unless you're printing to a secure pipe.
