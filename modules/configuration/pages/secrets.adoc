= Secrets

This topic outlines how to add secrets to a Redpanda Connect config without exposing them.

== Using environment variables

One of the most prolific approaches to providing secrets to a service is via environment variables. {page-component-title} allows you to inject the values of environment variables into a configuration with the interpolation syntax `+${FOO}+`, within a config it looks like this:

[source,yml]
----
thing:
  super_secret: "${SECRET}"
----

[NOTE]
.Use quotes
====
Note that it would be valid to have `+super_secret: ${SECRET}+` above (without the quotes), but if `SECRET` is unset then the config becomes structurally different. Therefore, it's always best to wrap environment variable interpolations with quotes so that when the variable is unset you still have a valid config (with an empty string).
====

More information about this syntax can be found on the xref:configuration:interpolation.adoc[interpolation field page].

== Using CLI flags

As an alternative to environment variables it's possible to set specific fields within a config using the CLI flag `--set` where the syntax is a `<path>=<value>` pair, the path being a xref:configuration:field_paths.adoc[dot-separated path to the field being set] and the value being the thing to set it to. If, for example, we had the config:

[source,yml]
----
thing:
  super_secret: ""
----

And we wanted to set the value of `super_secret` to a value stored within something like Hashicorp Vault we could run the config using the `--set` flag with backticks to execute a shell command for the value:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rpk connect run -c ./config.yaml \
  --set "thing.super_secret=`vault kv get -mount=secret thing_secret`"
----

Using this method we can inject the secret into the config without "leaking" it into an environment variable.

== Avoiding leaked secrets

There are a few ways in which configs parsed by {page-component-title} can be exported back out of the service. In all of these cases {page-component-title} will attempt to scrub any field values within the config that are known secrets (any field marked as a secret in the docs).

However, if you're embedding secrets within a config outside of the value of secret fields, maybe as part of a Bloblang mapping, then care should be made to avoid exposing the resulting config. This specifically means you should not enable xref:components:http/about.adoc#debug-endpoints[debug HTTP endpoints] when the port is exposed, and don't use the `rpk connect run echo` subcommand on configs containing secrets unless you're printing to a secure pipe.
