= Create a Discord Bot
:description: Learn how to use {page-component-title} to create a Discord bot.

This cookbook outlines how {page-component-title} can be used to create a Discord bot for important tasks such as providing insults and bad jokes to your chat. If you're a member of the https://discord.gg/6VaWjzP[{page-component-title} Discord server^] then you're likely already familiar with Blob Bot which is the resulting product.

== Consuming messages

Before you start messing with {page-component-title} you need to register a new bot with the https://discord.com/developers/applications[Discord Developer Portal^]. Start by building an Application, then use the build-a-bot page to choose a bot name and avatar. You should end up with a token generated for the bot, and you'll also need to add it to your server.

As soon as your bot is added to your server and you have a token you can immediately begin consuming messages from a channel with the xref:components:inputs/discord.adoc[`discord` input]:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  discord:
    channel_id: ${DISCORD_CHANNEL}
    bot_token: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
    cache: request_tracking

cache_resources:
  - label: request_tracking
    file:
      directory: /tmp/discord_bot
----

____
If you aren't sure how to access the ID of a channel try https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-[this tutorial^].
____

The `poll_period` shouldn't be too short as it'll exhaust your rate limits. If you plan to use the bot for hitting multiple Discord APIs then give it a fair few seconds between each poll. It's also necessary to point the input to a xref:components:caches/about.adoc[cache resource], and this will be used to store the ID of the latest message received for paginating the messages endpoint.

The `limit` is the maximum number of messages to consume from the channel when we haven't got a message to track and are consuming a backlog. The first time we run our bot we will pull a maximum of 10 of the latest messages in the channel, the maximum you can set here is 100.

If you were to run this config (setting the channel and bot token as env vars in a file called `testing.env`) you'll see it print messages from the channel to stdout in JSON form:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rpk connect run -e testing.env -c ./config.yaml
{"content":"so i like totally just tripped over my own network cables","author":{"id":"1234"}}
{"content":"like omg that is SO you!!!","author":{"id":"4321"}}
{"content":"yas totally","author":{"id":"1234"}}
{"content":"yeah","author":{"id":"4321"}}
----

== Writing messages

Writing messages to a Discord channel is pretty easy. You can feed the xref:components:outputs/discord.adoc[`discord` output] either a JSON object following the https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#message-object[Message Object structure^], or just a raw string and the structure will be created for you. Therefore we can write a hypothetical uppercasing echo bot with a simple xref:guides:bloblang/about.adoc[Bloblang mapping]:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = if !this.content.has_prefix("SHOUTS BACK") {
          "SHOUTS BACK BOT SAYS " + this.content.uppercase()
        } else {
          deleted()
        }

output:
  discord:
    channel_id: ${DISCORD_CHANNEL}
    bot_token: ${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
----

If we add that to the end of the first config you should see the bot respond to messages in the channel by posting an uppercase version of it with a prefix. Note that we also delete the message in our mapping if it has the same prefix that we're adding ourselves, which is a quick and dirty way of ensuring the bot doesn't echo its own messages.

== Custom commands

Shout bot is clearly an absolute riot and a true fan favourite. However, it will get old fast. Let's make our bot more elegant by introducing some commands by swapping our plain mapping with a xref:components:processors/switch.adoc[`switch` processor]:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - switch:
        - check: this.type == 7
          processors:
            - mapping: 'root = "Welcome to the server <@%v>!".format(this.author.id)'

        - processors:
            - mapping: 'root = deleted()'
----

By changing our mapping out to this switch we can add specialised commands for different message types, and if none of the cases match then we don't respond. Technically, we can do all of this within a single Bloblang mapping by using a match expression, but having a switch processor would also allow us to add cases where we do cool things like hit other APIs, etc.

The only case we've added here is one that activates when the message type is a specific one sent when a new person joins, and in response we give them a warm welcome. The welcome mentions the new user by injecting the user id into the welcome string with `.format(this.author.id)`, which replaces the `%v` placeholder with the author ID (the user that joined and therefore created the join message).

This response is cool but not very interactive, let's add a few commands that people can play with:

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - switch:
        - check: this.type == 7
          processors:
            - mapping: 'root = "Welcome to the server <@%v>!".format(this.author.id)'

        - check: this.content == "/joke"
          processors:
            - mapping: |
                let jokes = [
                  "What do you call a belt made of watches? A waist of time.",
                  "What does a clock do when it’s hungry? It goes back four seconds.",
                  "A company is making glass coffins. Whether they’re successful remains to be seen.",
                ]
                root = $jokes.index(timestamp_unix_nano() % $jokes.length())

        - check: this.content == "/roast"
          processors:
            - mapping: |
                let roasts = [
                  "If <@%v>'s brain was dynamite, there wouldn’t be enough to blow their hat off.",
                  "Someday you’ll go far <@%v>, and I really hope you stay there.",
                  "I’d give you a nasty look, but you’ve already got one <@%v>.",
                ]
                root = $roasts.index(timestamp_unix_nano() % $roasts.length()).format(this.author.id)

        - processors:
            - mapping: 'root = deleted()'
----

Here we have two new commands. If someone posts a message "/joke" then we respond by selecting one of several exceptionally funny jokes from a static list in the mapping.

The second new command is "/roast" and is exclusively for brave souls as the responses can be cruel and personal. The command works similarly to "/joke" with the exception being the ID of the user that made the command will be injected into the roast, as mentioning the target of the roast makes it significantly more heartbreaking (as intended).

== Hitting other APIs

Clicking websites and browsing the internet is very difficult and most people are simply too busy for it, it'd therefore be useful if we could have our bot do some browsing for us occasionally.

The final command we're going to add to our bot is "/release", where it will hit the Github API and find out for us what the latest {page-component-title} release is:

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - switch:
        # Other cases omitted for brevity
        - check: this.content == "/release"
          processors:
            - mapping: 'root = ""'
            - try:
              - http:
                  url: https://api.github.com/repos/{project-github}/releases/latest
                  verb: GET
              - mapping: 'root = "The latest release of {page-component-title} is %v: %v".format(this.tag_name, this.html_url)'

    - catch:
      - log:
          fields_mapping: 'root.error = error()'
          message: "Failed to process message"
      - mapping: 'root = "Sorry, my circuits are all bent from twerking and I must have malfunctioned."'
----

Here we've added a switch case that clears the contents of the message, hits the Github API to obtain the latest {page-component-title} release as a JSON object, and finally maps the tag name and the URL of the release to a useful message.

____
We're hitting the Github API with the xref:components:processors/http.adoc[generic `http` processor], which can be configured to work with most HTTP based APIs. In fact, the Discord input and output are actually xref:configuration:templating.adoc[configuration templates] that use the generic HTTP components https://github.com/{project-github}/blob/master/template/outputs/discord.yaml[under the hood^].
____

Since this command is networked and therefore has a chance of failure we've added some xref:configuration:error_handling.adoc[error handling] mechanisms after the switch processor so that it'd capture errors from this new case and any new cases we add later.

Within the catch block we simply log the error for the admin to peruse and change the response message out for a generic "whoopsie daisy" apology.

The full config for Blob Bot (with some super secret responses redacted) can be found https://github.com/{project-github}/blob/master/config/examples/discord_bot.yaml[in the Github repo^].
