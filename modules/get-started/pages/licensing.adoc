:description: Learn how to purchase and apply an Enterprise Edition license.

Anyone can use the Certified and Community connectors, but you need an Enterprise Edition license to use Enterprise connectors. 

== Purchase an Enterprise Edition license

You can purchase and download a license from the https://www.redpanda.com/upgrade[Redpanda website^].

== Apply a license key to Redpanda Connect

Once you have downloaded a license key, you can apply it in the following ways:

. Run the following command:

+
```bash
rpk connect run --redpanda-license <license-key> ./<connect-configuration>.yaml
```
+
Replace the following placeholder: 

- `<license-key>`: The full license key string.
- `<connect-configuration>`: The name of your Redpanda Connect configuration file.

. Save the license key to the following directory: `/etc/redpanda/redpanda.license`. 
. Set the environment variable: `$\{REDPANDA_LICENSE_FILEPATH}` to point to the file where the license key is stored.

Redpanda Connect checks the license key status at runtime. If the license key is unavailable or has expired, you are blocked from using Enterprise connectors.

You can view the license keyâ€™s expiration date at any time in the Redpanda Connect logs.
