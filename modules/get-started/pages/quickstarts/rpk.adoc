= Get Started with Redpanda Connect using `rpk`
:description: pass:q[Deploy your first pipelines using Redpanda Connect and `rpk`.]
:page-aliases: getting_started:overview.adoc, ROOT:install.adoc, guides:getting_started.adoc

This guide explains how to get started with Redpanda Connect using `rpk`, the Redpanda command-line interface (CLI). You can also install and run `rpk` in <<fips-compliance,FIPS compliance mode>>.

== Install

The `rpk` CLI allows you to create and manage data pipelines with Redpanda Connect as well as xref:ROOT:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[interact with Redpanda clusters].

NOTE: The `rpk` CLI also includes an `rpk connect` plugin, which manages installations and upgrades of Redpanda Connect. This plugin is automatically installed when you first run `rpk connect` commands, unless you run `rpk connect --version`, which prompts you to install the plugin.

[%collapsible]
.Also interacting with a Redpanda cluster?
====
If you want to use `rpk` to also communicate with a Redpanda cluster, ensure the version of `rpk` that you install matches the version of Redpanda running in your cluster.
====

=== Linux

include::ROOT:get-started:partial$install-rpk-linux.adoc[]

==== FIPS compliance

include::components:partial$enterprise_feature_note.adoc[]

To install `rpk` to run the latest version of Redpanda Connect in FIPS-compliant mode, you must install the `redpanda-rpk-fips` and `redpanda-connect-fips` packages. Both packages are built using the https://github.com/microsoft/go[Microsoft GoLang compiler^] and the https://github.com/microsoft/go-crypto-openssl[Microsoftâ€™s Go Crypto OpenSSL package^], which uses the FIPS-approved version of OpenSSL.

IMPORTANT: The packages for FIPS-compliant `rpk` (`redpanda-rpk-fips`) and Redpanda `rpk` (`redpanda-rpk`) are mutually exclusive, and so cannot be installed in the same environment.

=== MacOS

=== Docker

To use `rpk` in Docker, you can use the Redpanda Docker image, which includes both Redpanda and `rpk` as part of the installation.

[source,bash]
----
docker pull docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/connect
----

== Run a pipeline

A Redpanda Connect stream pipeline is configured with a single xref:configuration:about.adoc[config file], you can generate a fresh one with:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rpk connect create > connect.yaml
----

NOTE: This command may take a few seconds to run. If this is the first `rpk connect` command you have run, the `rpk connect plugin` is automatically installed.

For Docker installations:

[,bash]
----
docker run --rm docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/connect create > ./connect.yaml
----

The main sections that make up a config are `input`, `pipeline` and `output`. When you generate a fresh config it'll simply pipe `stdin` to `stdout` like this:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  stdin: {}

pipeline:
  processors: []

output:
  stdout: {}
----

Eventually we'll want to configure a more useful xref:components:inputs/about.adoc[input] and xref:components:outputs/about.adoc[output], but for now this is useful for quickly testing processors. You can execute this config with:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rpk connect run connect.yaml
----

For Docker installations:

[,bash]
----
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/connect.yaml:/connect.yaml docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/connect run
----

Anything you write to stdin will get written unchanged to stdout, cool! Resist the temptation to play with this for hours, there's more stuff to try out.

Next, let's add some processing steps in order to mutate messages. The most powerful one is the xref:components:processors/mapping.adoc[`mapping` processor] which allows us to perform mappings, let's add a mapping to uppercase our messages:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  stdin: {}

pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: root = content().uppercase()

output:
  stdout: {}
----

Now your messages should come out in all caps.

You can add as many xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processing steps] as you like, and since processors are what make Redpanda Connect powerful they are worth experimenting with. Let's create a more advanced pipeline that works with JSON documents:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  stdin: {}

pipeline:
  processors:
    - sleep:
        duration: 500ms
    - mapping: |
        root.doc = this
        root.first_name = this.names.index(0).uppercase()
        root.last_name = this.names.index(-1).hash("sha256").encode("base64")

output:
  stdout: {}
----

First, we sleep for 500 milliseconds just to keep the suspense going. Next, we restructure our input JSON document by nesting it within a field `doc`, we map the upper-cased first element of `names` to a new field `first_name`. Finally, we map the hashed and base64 encoded value of the last element of `names` to a new field `last_name`.

Try running that config with some sample documents:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
echo '{"id":"1","names":["celine","dion"]}
{"id":"2","names":["chad","robert","kroeger"]}' | rpk connect run connect.yaml
----

For Docker installations:

[,bash]
----
echo '{"id":"1","names":["celine","dion"]}
{"id":"2","names":["chad","robert","kroeger"]}' | docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd)/connect.yaml:/connect.yaml docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/connect run
----

You should see this output in the logs:

[source,json]
----
{"doc":{"id":"1","names":["celine","dion"]},"first_name":"CELINE","last_name":"1VvPgCW9sityz5XAMGdI2BTA7/44Wb3cANKxqhiCo50="}
{"doc":{"id":"2","names":["chad","robert","kroeger"]},"first_name":"CHAD","last_name":"uXXg5wCKPjpyj/qbivPbD9H9CZ5DH/F0Q1Twytnt2hQ="}
