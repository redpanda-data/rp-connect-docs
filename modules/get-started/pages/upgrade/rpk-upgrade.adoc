= Upgrade Redpanda Connect using `rpk`
:description: pass:q[Upgrade Redpanda Connect using the `rpk connect` plugin.]

Redpanda Connect uses the `rpk connect` plugin to manage upgrades, which is automatically installed when you start to run `rpk connect` commands from the `rpk` CLI. You do not need to upgrade the entire `rpk` CLI.

== Upgrade Redpanda Connect

The simplest way to upgrade is to use the <<upgrade-to-the-latest-version,`rpk connect upgrade` command>>. But if required, you can also upgrade (or downgrade) to a specific Redpanda Connect version.

NOTE: After upgrading (or downgrading), you must restart a pipeline to use features in the Redpanda Connect version you have deployed.

=== Prerequisites

- xref:guides:getting_started.adoc[`rpk` CLI installed]
- Review the https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/releases[release notes^] of the Redpanda Connect version you want to upgrade to.

=== Upgrade to the latest version

Upgrade to the latest version of Redpanda Connect.

. Check the version of Redpanda Connect already installed.
+
[,bash]
----
rpk connect --version
----

. Upgrade to the latest released version.

+
[,bash]
----
rpk connect upgrade
----
+
Example output:
+
[source,bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
Redpanda Connect successfully upgraded from 4.38.0 to the latest version ({latest-connect-version}).
----

For a full list of `rpk connect upgrade` options, run:

[,bash]
----
rpk connect upgrade --help
----

=== Upgrade to a specific version

Force an upgrade (or downgrade) to a specific version of Redpanda Connect using the following command. 

[,bash]
----
rpk connect install --connect-version <version> --force
----

Replace the `<version>` placeholder with the full version number, for example: `4.38.0`. You may need to wait a few seconds before the installation completes.


Example output:

```bash
Redpanda Connect 4.38.0 successfully installed.
```

=== Uninstall the `rpk connect` plugin

If you no longer want to use Redpanda Connect, you can uninstall the `rpk connect` plugin from the CLI.


[,bash]
----
rpk connect uninstall
----

Example output:

```bash
PATH                                                MESSAGE
/Users/username/.local/bin/.rpk.managed-connect     OK
```
