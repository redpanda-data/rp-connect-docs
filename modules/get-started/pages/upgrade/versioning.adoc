= Redpanda Connect Versioning
:description: Learn how Redpanda Connect implements versioning.

Redpanda Connect uses semantic versioning. Version numbers follow the format `major.minor.patch`:

- `major`: This version may include breaking changes.
- `minor`: This version only includes backward-compatible new features or enhancements.
- `patch`: This version includes backward-compatible bug fixes.

For example, version 4.35.1 is the first patch release of bug fixes following the minor release of product enhancements in 4.35.0. Breaking changes would not be released until 5.0.0.
