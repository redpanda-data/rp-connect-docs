:description: Find out about AWS components in Redpanda Connect.

There are many components within Redpanda Connect which utilize AWS services. You will find that each of these components contains a configuration section under the field `credentials`, of the format:

[source,yml]
----
credentials:
  profile: ""
  id: ""
  secret: ""
  token: ""
  role: ""
  role_external_id: ""
----

This section contains many fields and it isn't immediately clear which of them are compulsory and which aren't. This document aims to make it clear what each field is responsible for and how it might be used.

== Credentials

The first thing to make clear is that _all_ of these fields are optional. When all fields are left blank Redpanda Connect will attempt to load credentials from a shared credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`). The profile loaded will be `default` unless the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable is set.

== Explicit credentials

By explicitly setting the credentials you are using at the component level it's possible to connect to components using different accounts within the same Redpanda Connect process.

=== Select a profile

If you are using your shared credentials file but wish to explicitly select a profile set the `profile` field:

[source,yml]
----
credentials:
  profile: foo
----

=== Manual

If you are using long term credentials for your account you only need to set the fields `id` and `secret`:

[source,yml]
----
credentials:
  id: foo     # aws_access_key_id
  secret: bar # aws_secret_access_key
----

If you are using short term credentials then you will also need to set the field `token`:

[source,yml]
----
credentials:
  id: foo     # aws_access_key_id
  secret: bar # aws_secret_access_key
  token: baz  # aws_session_token
----

== Assume a role

It's also possible to configure Redpanda Connect to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html[assume a role^] using your credentials by setting the field `role` to your target role ARN.

[source,yml]
----
credentials:
  role: fooarn # Role ARN
----

This does NOT require explicit credentials, but it's possible to use both.

If you need to assume a role owned by another organization they might require you to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user_externalid.html[provide an external ID^], in which case place it in the field `role_external_id`:

[source,yml]
----
credentials:
  role: fooarn # Role ARN
  role_external_id: bar_id
----
