= Ingest Real-Time Sensor Telemetry with the HTTP Gateway
:description: Learn how to stream sensor telemetry data into Redpanda Cloud using the gateway input in Redpanda Connect.
:page-categories: Redpanda Connect, Cloud, Tutorials, Gateway, IoT

In this guide, you'll build a pipeline that uses the `gateway` input to receive real-time telemetry data from sensors over HTTP. Each incoming message is normalized, published to a Redpanda topic, and acknowledged back to the sender.

This setup is ideal for IoT, mobile, and embedded systems that need to stream data to Redpanda Cloud without using a Kafka client.

The `gateway` input exposes a secure HTTP endpoint, simplifying ingestion from devices. Because HTTP is universally supported, it's easier to integrate on constrained devices, microcontrollers, or languages that don't support Kafka natively.

Additional benefits:

- *Simplified security*: Devices authenticate with Redpanda Cloud API tokens (using Bearer headers). No need to embed Kafka credentials, manage TLS, or expose brokers publicly.

- *Operational flexibility*: Devices are decoupled from Kafka internals like topics or schemas. You can evolve pipeline logic without touching device code.

- *Automatic provisioning*: Redpanda Cloud generates a secure endpoint URL when you deploy the pipeline.

== Prerequisites

* A Redpanda Cloud cluster (Serverless, Dedicated, or BYOC)
* cURL or another compatible HTTP client

== Create a sensor user in Redpanda Cloud

A sensor user is required to securely authenticate and manage access to the `sensor.telemetry` topic, ensuring that only authorized devices can produce messages to the topic.

. link:https://cloud.redpanda.com[Log in to Redpanda Cloud^].
. Go to *Topics* and create a topic named `sensor.telemetry`. This topic will be used to store incoming telemetry messages.
. Go to *Security* and create a user with the following details:
- **Username**: `sensor-sasl-user`
- **Password**: `<password>` (choose a secure password)
- **SASL Mechanism**: `SCRAM-SHA-256`
. Copy the password and save it securely for the next step.
. Go to *Secrets Store* and create a new secret named `SENSOR_SASL_PASSWORD` with the value of the password you set for the user.
- Set the scope of the secret to Redpanda Cluster and Redpanda Connect.
. Go to *Security > ACLs* and create an access policy for the `sensor-sasl-user` user. This policy should allow the user to produce messages to the `sensor.telemetry` topic.

== Create a service account

The service account is used to authenticate requests to the gateway endpoint. It provides a secure way to manage access to the gateway without embedding sensitive credentials in your devices.

. link:https://cloud.redpanda.com/service-accounts/new[Create a new service account^] in Redpanda Cloud named `sensor-ingest` and give it a description like "Service account for sensor telemetry ingestion".
. Copy the client ID and secret.
. Request a new API token for the service account. This token will be used to authenticate requests to the gateway.
+
[,bash]
----
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://auth.prd.cloud.redpanda.com/oauth/token' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=client_credentials \
  --data client_id=<client-id> \
  --data client_secret=<client-secret> \
  --data audience=cloudv2-production.redpanda.cloud
----
+
Replace `<client-id>` and `<client-secret>` with the values you copied from the service account.
The request response provides an access token that remains *valid for one hour*.

. Set the access token as an environment variable:
+
[,bash]
----
export CLOUD_API_TOKEN=<access_token>
----

== Create a Redpanda Cloud pipeline

. Go to *Connect* and click *Create Pipeline*.
. Name the pipeline `sensor-telemetry-ingest` and give it a description like "Ingest real-time sensor telemetry data".
. Paste the following pipeline configuration into the editor:
+
[source,yaml]
----
input:
  gateway:
    rate_limit: "limit"

rate_limit_resources:
  - label: limit
    local:
      count: 100
      interval: 1s

pipeline:
  processors:
    - bloblang: |
        root.sensor_id = this.sensor_id
        root.type = this.type
        root.value = this.value
        root.unit = this.unit
        root.received_at = now()

output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out_sequential
    outputs:
      - redpanda:
          seed_brokers:
            - ${REDPANDA_BROKERS}
          topic: sensor.telemetry
          tls:
            enabled: true
          sasl:
            - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
              username: sensor-sasl-user
              password: ${secrets.SENSOR_SASL_PASSWORD}
      - sync_response:
          processors:
            - mapping: |
                root = {
                  "status": "ok",
                  "received_at": now()
                }
----
+
This pipeline listens for incoming telemetry messages over HTTP and processes each one in real time. Here's what each section does:
+
- `input.gateway`: Defines the input source. It exposes a secure HTTP endpoint that devices can post to. The optional `rate_limit` named `limit` is applied to protect the pipeline from overload.
- `rate_limit_resources.limit`: Limits traffic to 100 requests per second. If this rate is exceeded, HTTP requests are rejected with a 429 response.
- `pipeline.processors.bloblang`: Normalizes the incoming message by copying fields and adding a `received_at` timestamp (using the current time).
- `output.broker`: Uses a `fan_out_sequential` pattern to send each message to two outputs:
** The first output publishes the normalized message to the `sensor.telemetry` Redpanda topic.
** The second output sends a synchronous JSON response back to the sender confirming receipt.

. Click *Start*.
+
The pipeline starts deploying. When the state changes to "Running", the pipeline is ready to accept incoming messages.

. Click the pipeline to view its details.
+
When the pipeline is deployed, a URL is displayed. This is the HTTP endpoint to which you'll post sensor data.

. Copy the URL.

== Send sensor data

Send test data using cURL. Replace `<gateway-url>` with the URL provided by Redpanda Cloud when you deployed the pipeline.

[source,bash]
----
curl -X POST <gateway-url> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUD_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sensor_id": "thermo-42",
    "type": "temperature",
    "value": 21.7,
    "unit": "C"
  }'
----

Expected response:

[source,json]
----
{
  "received_at":"2025-06-17T09:48:50.986719231Z",
  "sensor_id":"thermo-42",
  "type":"temperature",
  "unit":"C",
  "value":21.7
}
----

You can verify that the message was successfully ingested by checking the `sensor.telemetry` topic in Redpanda Cloud.

To verify that the rate limit is working, try sending more than 100 requests per second. You should receive a 429 response with a `Retry-After` header indicating when to retry.

[,bash]
----
seq 1 300 | xargs -n1 -P50 -I{} curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
  -X POST <gateway-url> \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUD_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sensor_id":"test", "value": 42}'
----

You should see a mixture of `200` and `429` responses, indicating that the rate limit is being enforced.

== Monitor the pipeline

You can monitor the pipeline's logs in the Redpanda Cloud UI.

. Go to *Connect* and select the `sensor-telemetry-ingest` pipeline.
. Click on the *Logs* tab to view real-time logs of the pipeline's activity.
You can see any errors that occur during processing.

== Next steps

- Filter or enrich events with conditional Bloblang.
- Route messages by `sensor.type` to different topics.
