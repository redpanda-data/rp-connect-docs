:description: Getting started with {page-component-title}.

This topic explains how to get started with {page-component-title}.

== Install

You can install {page-component-title} using the `rpk` command-line tool (CLI). The `rpk` CLI allows you to create and manage data pipelines with {page-component-title} as well as xref:ROOT:get-started:rpk-install.adoc[interact with Redpanda clusters].

.Also interacting with a Redpanda cluster?
====
If you want to use `rpk` to also communicate with a Redpanda cluster, ensure the version of `rpk` that you install matches the version of Redpanda running in your cluster.
====

=== Linux

include::ROOT:get-started:partial$install-rpk-linux.adoc[]

=== MacOS

include::ROOT:get-started:partial$install-rpk-macos.adoc[]

=== Docker

To use `rpk` in Docker, you can use the Redpanda Docker image, which includes both Redpanda and `rpk` as part of the installation.

[source,bash]
----
docker pull docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda
----

== Run

A {page-component-title} stream pipeline is configured with a single xref:configuration:about.adoc[config file], you can generate a fresh one with:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rpk connect create > connect.yaml
----

For Docker installations:

[,bash]
----
docker run --rm docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda connect create > ./connect.yaml
----

The main sections that make up a config are `input`, `pipeline` and `output`. When you generate a fresh config it'll simply pipe `stdin` to `stdout` like this:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  stdin: {}

pipeline:
  processors: []

output:
  stdout: {}
----

Eventually we'll want to configure a more useful xref:components:inputs/about.adoc[input] and xref:components:outputs/about.adoc[output], but for now this is useful for quickly testing processors. You can execute this config with:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
rpk connect run connect.yaml
----

For Docker installations:

[,bash]
----
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/connect.yaml:/connect.yaml docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda connect run
----

Anything you write to stdin will get written unchanged to stdout, cool! Resist the temptation to play with this for hours, there's more stuff to try out.

Next, let's add some processing steps in order to mutate messages. The most powerful one is the xref:components:processors/mapping.adoc[`mapping` processor] which allows us to perform mappings, let's add a mapping to uppercase our messages:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  stdin: {}

pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: root = content().uppercase()

output:
  stdout: {}
----

Now your messages should come out in all caps.

You can add as many xref:components:processors/about.adoc[processing steps] as you like, and since processors are what make {page-component-title} powerful they are worth experimenting with. Let's create a more advanced pipeline that works with JSON documents:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  stdin: {}

pipeline:
  processors:
    - sleep:
        duration: 500ms
    - mapping: |
        root.doc = this
        root.first_name = this.names.index(0).uppercase()
        root.last_name = this.names.index(-1).hash("sha256").encode("base64")

output:
  stdout: {}
----

First, we sleep for 500 milliseconds just to keep the suspense going. Next, we restructure our input JSON document by nesting it within a field `doc`, we map the upper-cased first element of `names` to a new field `first_name`. Finally, we map the hashed and base64 encoded value of the last element of `names` to a new field `last_name`.

Try running that config with some sample documents:

[,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
echo '{"id":"1","names":["celine","dion"]}
{"id":"2","names":["chad","robert","kroeger"]}' | rpk connect run connect.yaml
----

For Docker installations:

[,bash]
----
echo '{"id":"1","names":["celine","dion"]}
{"id":"2","names":["chad","robert","kroeger"]}' | docker run --rm -i -v $(pwd)/connect.yaml:/connect.yaml docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda connect run
----

You should see this output in the logs:

[source,json]
----
{"doc":{"id":"1","names":["celine","dion"]},"first_name":"CELINE","last_name":"1VvPgCW9sityz5XAMGdI2BTA7/44Wb3cANKxqhiCo50="}
{"doc":{"id":"2","names":["chad","robert","kroeger"]},"first_name":"CHAD","last_name":"uXXg5wCKPjpyj/qbivPbD9H9CZ5DH/F0Q1Twytnt2hQ="}
