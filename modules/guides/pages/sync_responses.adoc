// tag::single-source[]
:description: Understand synchronous response handling in Redpanda Connect, ensuring reliable and efficient data processing.

In a regular Redpanda Connect pipeline, messages flow in one direction and acknowledgements in the other:

[source,text]
----
    ----------- Message ------------->

Input (AMQP) -> Processors -> Output (AMQP)

    <------- Acknowledgement ---------
----

However, Redpanda Connect supports bidirectional protocols like HTTP and WebSocket, which allow responses to be returned directly from the pipeline.

For example, HTTP is a request/response protocol, and inputs like `http_server` (Self-Managed) or `gateway` (Redpanda Cloud) support returning response payloads to the requester.

[source,text]
----
           --------- Request Body -------->

Input (HTTP) -> Processors -> Output (Sync Response)

           <--- Response Body (and ack) ---
----

== Routing processed messages back

To return a processed response, use the xref:components:outputs/sync_response.adoc[`sync_response`] output.

ifdef::env-cloud[]
Use the `gateway` input in Redpanda Cloud:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  gateway: {}

pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = {
          city: json("location"),
          forecast: "Clear skies with light winds",
          temperature_c: 22
        }

output:
  sync_response: {}
----
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
Use the `http_server` input in Self-Managed deployments:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  http_server:
    path: /weather

pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: |
        root = {
          city: json("location"),
          forecast: "Clear skies with light winds",
          temperature_c: 22
        }

output:
  sync_response: {}
----
endif::[]

Sending this request:

[source,json]
----
{ "location": "Berlin" }
----

Returns:

[source,json]
----
{
  "city": "Berlin",
  "forecast": "Clear skies with light winds",
  "temperature_c": 22
}
----

== Combine with other outputs

You can route processed messages to storage and return a response using a xref:components:outputs/broker.adoc[`broker`] output.

ifdef::env-cloud[]
[source,yaml]
----
input:
  gateway: {}

output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
      - redpanda:
          seed_brokers:
            - ${REDPANDA_BROKERS}
          topic: weather.requests
          tls:
            enabled: true
          sasl:
            - mechanism: SCRAM-SHA-256
              username: ${secrets.USERNAME}
              password: ${secrets.PASSWORD}
      - sync_response:
          processors:
            - mapping: |
                root = {
                  status: "received",
                  received_at: now()
                }
----
endif::[]

ifndef::env-cloud[]
[source,yaml]
----
input:
  http_server:
    path: /weather

output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
      - kafka:
          addresses: [localhost:9092]
          topic: weather.requests
      - sync_response:
          processors:
            - mapping: |
                root = {
                  status: "received",
                  received_at: now()
                }
----
endif::[]

== Returning partially processed messages

You can return a response before the message is fully processed by using the xref:components:processors/sync_response.adoc[`sync_response` processor].

This allows continued processing after the response is set.

[source,yaml]
----
pipeline:
  processors:
    - mapping: root = "Received weather report for %s".format(json("location"))
    - sync_response: {}
    - mapping: root.reported_at = now()
----

This returns `"Received weather report for Berlin"` to the client, but continues modifying the message before storing or forwarding it.

[NOTE]
====
Due to delivery guarantees, the response is not sent until all downstream processing and acknowledgements are complete.

== Routing output responses back

Some outputs, such as xref:components:outputs/http_client.adoc[`http_client`], support returning a downstream response back to the input.

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  http_server:
    path: /proxy-weather

output:
  http_client:
    url: https://api.example.com/forecast
    verb: POST
    propagate_response: true
----

This forwards the request to an external weather API and returns its response to the original requester.

You can combine this with other outputs:

[source,yaml]
----
input:
  http_server:
    path: /proxy-weather

output:
  broker:
    pattern: fan_out
    outputs:
      - kafka:
          addresses: [localhost:9092]
          topic: weather.proxy
      - http_client:
          url: https://api.example.com/forecast
          verb: POST
          propagate_response: true
----
