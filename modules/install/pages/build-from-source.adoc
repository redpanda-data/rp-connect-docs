= Build or Upgrade from Source
:description: Build or upgrade Redpanda Connect from source.

You can build Redpanda Connect in two ways:

* *Standard build*: Suitable for most users. Does not require cgo. Does not include the xref:components:inputs/tigerbeetle_cdc.adoc[TigerBeetle CDC input connector].
* *cgo-enabled build*: Required only if you need the TigerBeetle CDC input connector.

== Install from source

. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from https://golang.org/dl/[the official Go website^].

. Clone the Redpanda Connect repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect.git
cd connect
----

. Build the binary (choose one):
+
[cols="1a,2a"]
|===
| Build type | Build command

| Standard (no cgo, most users)
|
[source,bash]
----
go build -o redpanda-connect ./cmd/redpanda-connect
----

| cgo-enabled (TigerBeetle CDC support)
|
[source,bash]
----
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o redpanda-connect ./cmd/redpanda-connect
----
|===

. Move the binary to a directory in your `PATH` (for example, `/usr/local/bin`):
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo mv redpanda-connect /usr/local/bin/
----
. Verify the installation:
+
[source,bash]
----
redpanda-connect --version
----

You should see a version.

== Upgrade a source build

. Navigate to your existing clone of the repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd connect
----

. Fetch the latest tags and check out the version you want:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
git fetch --all
git checkout v{latest-connect-version}
----

. Rebuild the binary (choose one):
+
[cols="1a,2a"]
|===
| Build type | Build command

| Standard (no cgo, most users)
|
[source,bash]
----
go build -o redpanda-connect ./cmd/redpanda-connect
----

| cgo-enabled (TigerBeetle CDC support)
|
[source,bash]
----
CGO_ENABLED=1 go build -o redpanda-connect ./cmd/redpanda-connect
----
|===

. Replace the previous binary and verify:
+
[source,bash]
----
sudo mv redpanda-connect /usr/local/bin/
redpanda-connect --version
----

NOTE: After upgrading (or downgrading), you must restart a pipeline to use features in the Redpanda Connect version you have deployed.

== Uninstall

To uninstall Redpanda Connect, remove the installed binary:

[source,sh]
----
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/redpanda-connect
----

This removes the Redpanda Connect binary from your system.
