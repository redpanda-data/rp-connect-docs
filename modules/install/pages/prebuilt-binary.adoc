= Install or Upgrade from a Prebuilt Binary
:description: Download, install, or upgrade Redpanda Connect from a prebuilt binary.

You can choose between two types of prebuilt binaries:

* *Standard binary*: Suitable for most users. Does not require cgo. Does not include the xref:components:inputs/tigerbeetle_cdc.adoc[TigerBeetle CDC input connector].
* *cgo-enabled binary*: Required only if you need the TigerBeetle CDC input connector. Only available for Linux AMD64.

== Install a prebuilt binary

. Ensure you have `wget` and `tar` installed.

. Download the desired Redpanda Connect binary for your platform. You can find a complete list of releases on the link:https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/releases[GitHub releases page^].

----
tar -xzf <filename>.tar.gz

sudo mv redpanda-connect /usr/local/bin/
----

. Verify the installation:
+
[source,bash]

== Upgrade a prebuilt binary

To upgrade, repeat the installation steps with the new version. Stop any running Redpanda Connect processes, download and extract the new binary, replace the old binary, and verify the upgrade.

NOTE: After upgrading (or downgrading), you must restart a pipeline to use features in the Redpanda Connect version you have deployed.

== Uninstall

To uninstall Redpanda Connect, remove the installed binary:

[source,sh]
----
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/redpanda-connect
----

This removes the Redpanda Connect binary from your system.
